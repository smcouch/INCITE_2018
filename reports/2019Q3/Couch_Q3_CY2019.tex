\end{figure}

So far in 2019 we expended 129.8M core-hours on Mira out of our total 2019 allocation of 150M core-hours (86.5\% usage). 
This is just slightly ahead of the linear usage curve.
Our burn rate in Q3 was substantially larger than for Q2.
We are now running two of our primary simulation milestones in the Capability queue and will start a second Capability-scale simulation in the next week or two. 
Figure \ref{fig:usage} we show our current usage and categorized hours on Mira.

After completely code tuning, and overcoming an issues with constructing a new set of initial conditions, we have begun production simulations on Theta in Q3. 
In just a couple weeks of production, we have expended 2.2M core-hours on Theta (12.5\% of total allocation) and the simulation has already grown to the Capability scale.
Based on our experience last year running on Theta, we do not anticipate any difficulty in expending our entire allocation before the end of the calendar year.

\section{Report on Project Milestones}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our milestones for Year 2, and corresponding progress, were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Long time simulations of MHD CCSNe - These simulations have been restarted from simulations carried over from 2018 and are running in the Capability queue. Substantial progress has been made on these simulations in Q3 and they are nearing completion.
    \item High-resolution simulation of MHD dynamos in the proto-neutron star - So far in Q1/Q2 we have analyzed simulations from 2018 that will serves as the initial conditions for this high-resolution simulation. We have started this simulation in Q3. Given the extreme resolution of this simulation, it will run in the Capability queue from the outset.
    \item MHD simulation of CCSN progenitors - These simulations will be started in Q2. We are tuning our progenitor application to make better use of OpenMP threading.
    \item CCSN simulation with 3D progenitors - This simulation is now running at Capability scale on Theta.
    \item Implement microphysics from TEAMS SciDAC collaboration and neutrino-electron scattering (NES) - the TEAMS microphysics package is not yet ready for production simulations. We have during Q1 finished an implementation of NES and are now using it in production on Theta.
\end{enumerate}

Our catalyst, Adrian Pope, has been extremely helpful.
He is now helping us tune our code for Theta.


\section{Code Description and Characterization}

\texttt{FLASH} is a highly capable, fully modular, extensible,
community code that is widely used in astrophysics, cosmology, fluid
dynamics, and plasma physics, and other fields.  The capabilities of
the FLASH code include adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), several
self-gravity solvers, an advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) flame
model, an accurate and detailed treatment of nuclear burning, and a
sophisticated two-moment neutrino transport scheme based on an
explicit hyperbolic solver.  The neutrino interactions are included
through the open-source neutrino interaction library
\texttt{NuLib}. We have enhanced the
performance of the two-moment neutrino transport scheme significantly
as well as upgraded the transport to now include full velocity and
gravitational red-shift dependence in the evolution equations.

\texttt{FLASH} is written in modern Fortran, with some utility
functions written in C, and a build system written in Python.  It
requires MPI library support, and either HDF5 or P-NetCDF for I/O.
Additional mathematical software, such as \texttt{Hypre}, may be
required to configure \texttt{FLASH} for particular simulations.

Algorithm classes used within \texttt{FLASH} include Sparse Linear
Algebra solvers, FFT, active and passive particles, structured grids,
and AMR.
