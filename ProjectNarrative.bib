  Abstract	= {We present self-consistent, axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations performed with the Prometheus-Vertex
		  code for 18 pre-supernova models in the range of 11-28 M
		  &sun;, including progenitors recently investigated by other
		  groups. All models develop explosions, but depending on the
		  progenitor structure, they can be divided into two classes.
		  With a steep density decline at the Si/Si-O interface, the
		  arrival of this interface at the shock front leads to a
		  sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid
		  approach to explosion. With a more gradually decreasing
		  accretion rate, it takes longer for the neutrino heating to
		  overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions set in
		  later. Early explosions are facilitated by high
		  mass-accretion rates after bounce and correspondingly high
		  neutrino luminosities combined with a pronounced drop of
		  the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O
		  interface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii
		  and receding shock fronts after the passage through their
		  maxima, our models exhibit short advection timescales,
		  which favor the efficient growth of the standing
		  accretion-shock instability. The latter plays a supportive
		  role at least for the initiation of the re-expansion of the
		  stalled shock before runaway. Taking into account the
		  effects of turbulent pressure in the gain layer, we derive
		  a generalized condition for the critical neutrino
		  luminosity that captures the explosion behavior of all
		  models very well. We validate the robustness of our
		  findings by testing the influence of stochasticity,
		  numerical resolution, and approximations in some aspects of
		  the microphysics.},

  Abstract	= {Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of
		  core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities
		  play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. The first
		  successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained
		  with self-consistent, first-principles simulations in three
		  spatial dimensions. But three-dimensional (3D) models tend
		  to be less prone to explosion than the corresponding
		  axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) ones. The reason is that
		  3D turbulence leads to energy cascading from large to small
		  spatial scales, the inverse of the 2D case, thus
		  disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest
		  scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a
		  lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, some
		  important component of robust and sufficiently energetic
		  neutrino-powered explosions may still be missing. Such a
		  deficit could be associated with progenitor properties such
		  as rotation, magnetic fields, or precollapse perturbations,
		  or with microphysics that could cause enhancement of
		  neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also
		  revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D ones,
		  such as spiral modes of the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-number
		  emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time-
		  and direction-dependent variations on the detectable
		  neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of
		  their consequences is still in its infancy.},

  Abstract	= {In the implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) paradigm, the
		  dissipative nature of high-resolution shock-capturing
		  schemes is exploited to provide an implicit model of
		  turbulence. The ILES approach has been applied to different
		  contexts, with varying degrees of success. It is the
		  de-facto standard in many astrophysical simulations and in
		  particular in studies of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN).
		  Recent 3D simulations suggest that turbulence might play a
		  crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions, however
		  the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these
		  studies is unclear. Especially considering that the
		  accuracy of ILES for the regime of interest in CCSN, weakly
		  compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been
		  systematically assessed before. Anisotropy, in particular,
		  could impact the dissipative properties of the flow and
		  enhance the turbulent pressure in the radial direction,
		  favouring the explosion. In this paper we assess the
		  accuracy of ILES using numerical methods most commonly
		  employed in computational astrophysics by means of a number
		  of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,
		  anisotropic turbulence. Our simulations employ several
		  different methods and span a wide range of resolutions. We
		  report a detailed analysis of the way in which the
		  turbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our
		  results suggest that anisotropy and compressibility in CCSN
		  turbulence have little effect on the turbulent kinetic
		  energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov scaling is obtained in the
		  inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic
		  energy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly
		  captured even at low resolutions, suggesting that very high
		  "effective Reynolds number" can be achieved at the largest
		  scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the dynamics
		  at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated
		  by the so-called bottleneck effect, i.e., the pile up of
		  kinetic energy close to the dissipation range due to the
		  partial suppression of the energy cascade by numerical
		  viscosity. An inertial range is not recovered until the
		  point where high resolution ˜5123, which would be
		  difficult to realize in global simulations, is reached. We
		  discuss the consequences for CCSN simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We conduct a series of numerical experiments into the
		  nature of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics in the
		  postbounce stalled-shock phase of core-collapse supernovae
		  using 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a
		  27 M&sun; progenitor star with a neutrino leakage/heating
		  scheme. We vary the strength of neutrino heating and find
		  three cases of 3D dynamics: (1) neutrino-driven convection,
		  (2) initially neutrino-driven convection and subsequent
		  development of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI), and (3) SASI-dominated evolution. This confirms
		  previous 3D results of Hanke et al. and Couch & Connor. We
		  carry out simulations with resolutions differing by up to a
		  factor of ˜4 and demonstrate that low resolution is
		  artificially favorable for explosion in the 3D
		  convection-dominated case since it decreases the efficiency
		  of energy transport to small scales. Low resolution results
		  in higher radial convective fluxes of energy and enthalpy,
		  more fully buoyant mass, and stronger neutrino heating. In
		  the SASI-dominated case, lower resolution damps SASI
		  oscillations. In the convection-dominated case, a
		  quasi-stationary angular kinetic energy spectrum E(l)
		  develops in the heating layer. Like other 3D studies, we
		  find E(l) ∝l-1 in the ``inertial range,'' while theory
		  and local simulations argue for E(l) ∝ l-5/3. We argue
		  that current 3D simulations do not resolve the inertial
		  range of turbulence and are affected by numerical viscosity
		  up to the energy-containing scale, creating a
		  ``bottleneck'' that prevents an efficient turbulent

  Abstract	= {Supernovae of Type II occur at the end of the evolution of

		  core under gravity is well understood and takes a fraction
		  of a second. To understand the phenomenon, a detailed
		  knowledge of the equation of state at the relevant
		  densities and temperatures is required. After collapse, the
		  shock wave moves outward, but probably does not succeed in
		  expelling the mass of the star. The most likely mechanism
		  to do so is the absorption of neutrinos from the core by
		  the material at medium distances. Observations and theory
		  connected with SN 1987A are discussed, as are the

  Abstract	= {By performing neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations
		  in spherical symmetry (1D) and axial symmetry (2D) with
		  different progenitor models by Woosley & Heger (2007) from
		  12 $M_\odot$ to 100 $M_\odot$, we find that all 1D runs
		  fail to produce explosion and several 2D runs succeed. The
		  difference of shock evolution can be interpreted by the
		  difference of mass accretion history, which is determined
		  by the density structure of the progenitor. The exploding
		  models exhibit high neutrino luminosity with low mass
		  accretion rate. This is consistent with the discussion
		  about the so-called critical curve in the mass accretion
		  rate and neutrino luminosity plane, above which there is no
		  steady solution of the accretion flow so that a dynamical
		  expanding shock wave is expected. In addition, we developed
		  a phenomenological model to evaluate the trajectories in
		  this plane. This model reasonably reproduces the numerical
		  results by using the initial density structure of the
		  progenitors alone. By this model, we can predict the
		  possibility of explosion by using the initial density
		  structure of the progenitors alone.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first successful simulation of a
		  neutrino-driven supernova explosion in three dimensions
		  (3D), using the Prometheus-Vertex code with an axis-free
		  Yin-Yang grid and a sophisticated treatment of
		  three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport. The
		  progenitor is a nonrotating, zero-metallicity 9.6 {{M}&sun;
		  } star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry
		  outward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after
		  bounce, a successful explosion starts at ˜130 ms
		  postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model explodes at
		  about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in
		  2D and a more quickly increasing and roughly 10% higher
		  explosion energy of >1050 erg. The more favorable explosion
		  conditions in 3D are explained by lower temperatures and
		  thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer below
		  the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and
		  leads to a bigger mass in the gain layer, whose larger
		  recombination energy boosts the explosion energy in 3D.
		  These differences are caused by less coherent, less
		  massive, and less rapid convective downdrafts associated
		  with postshock convection in 3D. The less violent impact of
		  these accretion downflows in the cooling layer produces
		  less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses
		  by neutrino emission. We thus have, for the first time,
		  identified a reduced mass accretion rate, lower infall
		  velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of
		  convective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock
		  turbulence that facilitate neutrino-driven explosions and
		  strengthen them compared to the 2D case.},

  Abstract	= {Hans Bethe contributed in many ways to our understanding

		  this day, a first principles model of how the explosion is
		  energized is lacking. Nevertheless, a quantitative theory
		  of nucleosynthesis is possible. We present a survey of the

		  metallicity in the mass range 12 120M. The most recent set
		  of solar abundances, opacities, mass loss rates, and
		  current estimates of nuclear reaction rates are employed.
		  Restrictions on the mass cut and explosion energy of the

		  The nucleosynthetic results, when integrated over a
		  Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), agree quite well with
		  what is seen in the sun. We discuss in some detail the
		  production of the long lived radioactivities, 26Al and

		  advanced spectral leakage for the heavy flavor neutrinos.
		  To trigger explosions in the otherwise non-exploding
		  simulations, the PUSH method increases the energy
		  deposition in the gain region proportionally to the heavy

		  18--21 {{M}}o . Our studies reveal a distinction between
		  high compactness (HC; compactness parameter {xi }1.75\gt
		  0.45) and low compactness (LC; {xi }1.75\lt 0.45)
		  progenitor models, where LC models tend to explode earlier,
		  with a lower explosion energy, and with a lower remnant

		  around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN 1987A. However, all the

  Abstract	= {Interactions with neutrons and protons play a crucial role
		  for the neutrino opacity of matter in the supernova core.
		  Their current implementation in many simulation codes,
		  however, is rather schematic and ignores not only
		  modifications for the correlated nuclear medium of the
		  nascent neutron star, but also free-space corrections from
		  nucleon recoil, weak magnetism, or strange quarks, which
		  can easily add up to changes of several 10% for neutrino
		  energies in the spectral peak. In the Garching supernova
		  simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, such
		  sophistications have been included for a long time except
		  for the strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin,
		  which affect neutral-current neutrino scattering. We
		  demonstrate on the basis of a 20 {M}o progenitor star that
		  a moderate strangeness-dependent contribution of
		  {g}{{a}}{{s}}=-0.2 to the axial-vector coupling constant
		  {g}{{a}}≈ 1.26 can turn an unsuccessful three-dimensional
		  (3D) model into a successful explosion. Such a modification
		  is in the direction of current experimental results and
		  reduces the neutral-current scattering opacity of neutrons,
		  which dominate in the medium around and above the
		  neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities and
		  mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the
		  neutrino-energy deposition in the heating layer. Higher
		  nonradial kinetic energy in the gain layer signals enhanced
		  buoyancy activity that enables the onset of the explosion
		  at ~300 ms after bounce, in contrast to the model with
		  vanishing strangeness contributions to neutrino--nucleon
		  scattering. Our results demonstrate the close proximity to
		  explosion of the previously published, unsuccessful 3D
		  models of the Garching group.},

		  supernova simulations for 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$
		  progenitors. All of the simulations yield explosions and
		  have been evolved for at least 1.2 seconds after core
		  bounce and 1 second after material first becomes unbound.
		  Simulations were computed with our Chimera code employing
		  spectral neutrino transport, special and general
		  relativistic transport effects, and state-of-the-art
		  neutrino interactions. Continuing the evolution beyond 1
		  second allows explosions to develop more fully and the
		  processes powering the explosions to become more clearly
		  evident. We compute explosion energy estimates, including
		  the binding energy of the stellar envelope outside the
		  shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38, and 0.70 B ($10^{51}$ ergs) and
		  increasing at 0.03, 0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 B s$^{-1}$,
		  respectively, for the 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$ models.
		  Three models developed pronounced prolate shock
		  morphologies, while the 20 $M_\odot$ model, though
		  exhibiting lobes and accretion streams like the other
		  models, develops an approximately spherical, off-center
		  shock as the explosion begins and then becomes moderately
		  prolate $\sim$600 ms after bounce. This reduces the
		  explosion energy relative to the other models by reducing
		  mass accretion during the critical explosion power-up
		  phase. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in our
		  models through detailed analyses of the energy sources and
		  flows. We find that the 12 and 20 $M_\odot$ models have
		  explosion energies comparable to that of the lower range of
		  observed explosion energies while the 15 and 25 $M_\odot$
		  models are within the range of observed explosion energies,
		  particularly considering the rate at which their explosion
		  energies are increasing. The ejected $^{56}$Ni masses given
		  by our models are all within observational limits as are
		  the proto-neutron star masses and kick velocities. (Truncated)},

  Abstract	= {We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulation of
		  the final minutes of iron core growth in a massive star, up
		  to and including the point of core gravitational
		  instability and collapse. We capture the development of
		  strong convection driven by violent Si burning in the shell
		  surrounding the iron core. This convective burning builds
		  the iron core to its critical mass and collapse ensues,
		  driven by electron capture and photodisintegration. The
		  non-spherical structure and motion generated by 3D
		  convection is substantial at the point of collapse, with
		  convective speeds of several hundreds of km s-1. We examine
		  the impact of such physically realistic 3D initial
		  conditions on the core-collapse supernova mechanism using
		  3D simulations including multispecies neutrino leakage and
		  find that the enhanced post-shock turbulence resulting from
		  3D progenitor structure aids successful explosions. We
		  conclude that non-spherical progenitor structure should not
		  be ignored, and should have a significant and favorable
		  impact on the likelihood for neutrino-driven explosions. In
		  order to make simulating the 3D collapse of an iron core
		  feasible, we were forced to make approximations to the
		  nuclear network making this effort only a first step toward

  Abstract	= {The mechanism for revival of a stalled supernova shock
		  found by Wilson (1982) in a computation is analyzed.
		  Neutrinos from the hot, inner core of the supernova are
		  absorbed in the outer layers, and although only about 0.1
		  percent of their energy is so absorbed, this is enough to
		  eject the outer part of the star and leave only enough mass
		  to form a neutron star. The neutrino absorption is
		  independent of the density of material. After the shock
		  recedes to some extent, neutrino heating establishes a
		  sufficient pressure gradient to push the material beyond
		  about 150 km outward, while the material further in falls
		  rapidly toward the core. This makes the density near 150 km
		  decrease spectacularly, creating a quasi-vacuum in which
		  the pressure is mainly carried by radiation. This is a
		  perfect condition to make the internal energy of the matter
		  sufficient to escape from the gravitational attraction of
		  the star. The net energy of the outgoing shock is about 4 x
		  10 to the 50th ergs.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first two-dimensional general relativistic
		  (GR) simulations of stellar core collapse and explosion
		  with the COCONUT hydrodynamics code in combination with the
		  VERTEX solver for energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino
		  transport, using the extended conformal flatness condition
		  for approximating the space-time metric and a
		  ray-by-ray-plus ansatz to tackle the multi-dimensionality
		  of the transport. For both of the investigated 11.2 and 15
		  M &sun; progenitors we obtain successful, though seemingly
		  marginal, neutrino-driven supernova explosions. This
		  outcome and the time evolution of the models basically
		  agree with results previously obtained with the PROMETHEUS
		  hydro solver including an approximative treatment of
		  relativistic effects by a modified Newtonian potential.
		  However, GR models exhibit subtle differences in the
		  neutrinospheric conditions compared with Newtonian and
		  pseudo-Newtonian simulations. These differences lead to
		  significantly higher luminosities and mean energies of the
		  radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and therefore
		  to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies
		  in the gain layer with favorable consequences for strong
		  nonradial mass motions and ultimately for an explosion.
		  Moreover, energy transfer to the stellar medium around the
		  neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering
		  reactions of heavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the
		  mentioned effects. Together with previous pseudo-Newtonian
		  models, the presented relativistic calculations suggest
		  that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging
		  neutrino interactions can make differences of even 50%-100%
		  in some quantities and is likely to contribute to a finally
		  successful explosion mechanism on no minor level than
		  hydrodynamical differences between different dimensions.},

  Abstract	= {A major goal over the last decade has been understanding
		  which multidimensional effects are crucial in facilitating
		  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Unfortunately,
		  much of this work has necessarily assumed axisymmetry. In
		  this work, we present analyses of simplified
		  two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CCSN models
		  with the goal of comparing the hydrodynamics in setups that
		  differ only in dimension. Not surprisingly, we find many
		  differences between 2D and 3D models. While some
		  differences are subtle and perhaps not crucial, others are
		  dramatic and make interpreting 2D models problematic. In
		  particular, axisymmetric models produce excess power at the
		  largest spatial scales, power that has been deemed critical
		  in previous explosion models. Nevertheless, our 3D models,
		  which have an order of magnitude less power than 2D models
		  on large scales, explode earlier. Since explosions occur
		  earlier in 3D than in 2D, the vigorous large-scale sloshing
		  is either not critical in any dimension or the explosion
		  mechanism operates differently in 2D and 3D. On the other
		  hand, we find that the average parcel of matter in the gain
		  region has been exposed to net heating for up to 30% longer
		  in 3D than in 2D, an effect we attribute to the differing
		  characters of turbulence in 2D and 3D. We suggest that this
		  effect plays a prominent role in producing earlier
		  explosions in 3D. Finally, we discuss a simple model for
		  the runaway growth of buoyant bubbles that is able to
		  quantitatively account for the growth of the shock radius
		  and predicts a critical luminosity relation.},

  Abstract	= {Neutrino transport and neutrino interactions in dense
		  matter play a crucial role in stellar core collapse,
		  supernova explosions and neutron star formation. Here we
		  present a detailed description of a new numerical code for
		  treating the time and energy dependent neutrino transport
		  in hydrodynamical simulations of such events. The code is
		  based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal with
		  the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann
		  equation. The moments of the neutrino distribution function
		  and the energy and lepton number exchange with the stellar
		  medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and
		  first order moment equations in combination with a model
		  Boltzmann equation. The latter is discretized on a grid of
		  tangent rays. The integration of the transport equations
		  and the neutrino source terms is performed in a
		  time-implicit way. In the present version of the program,
		  the transport part is coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics
		  code which follows the evolution of the stellar plasma by a
		  finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic
		  interpolation, using a Riemann solver to calculate the
		  hydrodynamic states. The neutrino source terms are
		  implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino transport
		  and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial
		  grids and different time steps. The structure of the
		  described code is modular and offers a high degree of
		  flexibility for an application to relativistic and
		  multi-dimensional problems at different levels of
		  refinement and accuracy. We critically evaluate results for
		  a number of test cases, including neutrino transport in
		  rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic
		  core collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code
		  to be used in multi-dimensional simulations of convection
		  in neutron stars and supernovae. Appendices A and B and all

  Abstract	= {Three-dimensional (3D) simulations of core-collapse
		  supernovae (CCSNe) are granting new insight into the
		  as-yet-uncertain mechanism that drives successful
		  explosions. While there is still debate about whether
		  explosions are obtained more easily in 3D than in 2D, it is
		  undeniable that there exist qualitative and quantitative
		  differences between the results of 3D and 2D simulations.
		  We present an extensive set of high-resolution 1D, 2D, and
		  3D CCSN simulations with multispecies neutrino leakage
		  carried out in two different progenitors. Our simulations
		  confirm the results of Couch indicating that 2D explodes
		  more readily than 3D. We argue that this is due to the
		  inadequacies of 2D to accurately capture important aspects
		  of the 3D dynamics. We find that without artificially
		  enhancing the neutrino heating rate, we do not obtain
		  explosions in 3D. We examine the development of
		  neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) and find that, in separate regimes,
		  either instability can dominate. We find evidence for
		  growth of the SASI for both 15 M &sun; and 27 M &sun;
		  progenitors; however, it is weaker in 3D exploding models.
		  The growth rate of both instabilities is artificially
		  enhanced along the symmetry axis in 2D as compared with our

		  growing consensus that CCSNe must be studied in 3D if we

  Abstract	= {We investigate the structure of the stalled supernova
		  shock in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D,
		  respectively) and explore the differences in the effects of
		  neutrino heating and the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI). We find that early on the amplitude of
		  the dipolar mode of the shock is factors of ~2-3 smaller in
		  3D than in 2D. However, later in both 3D and 2D, the
		  monopole and dipole modes start to grow until explosion.
		  Whereas in 2D, the (l, m) = (1, 0) mode changes sign
		  quasi-periodically, producing the "up-and-down" motion
		  always seen in modern 2D simulations, in 3D this almost
		  never happens. Rather, in 3D when the dipolar mode starts
		  to grow, it grows in magnitude and wanders stochastically
		  in direction until settling before explosion to a
		  particular patch of solid angle. Furthermore, in 2D, we
		  find that the amplitude of the dipolar shock deformation
		  separates into two classes. For the first, identified with
		  the SASI and for a wide range of "low" neutrino
		  luminosities, this amplitude remains small and roughly
		  constant. For the other, identified with higher
		  luminosities and neutrino-driven convection, the dipolar
		  amplitude grows sharply. Importantly, it is only for this
		  higher luminosity class that we see neutrino-driven
		  explosions within ~1 s of bounce. Moreover, for the "low"
		  luminosity runs (including zero), the power spectra of
		  these dipolar oscillations peak in the 30-50 Hz range
		  associated with advection timescales, while for the
		  high-luminosity runs the power spectra at lower frequencies
		  are significantly more prominent. We associate this
		  enhanced power at lower frequencies with slower convective
		  effects and the secular growth of the dipolar shock
		  amplitude. Though our study involves a simplified,
		  parameterized approach, on the basis of it we hypothesize
		  that neutrino-driven buoyant convection should almost
		  always dominate the SASI when the supernova explosion is
		  neutrino-driven.},

  Abstract	= {Following a simulation approach of recent publications, we
		  explore the viability of the neutrino-heating explosion
		  mechanism's dependence on the spatial dimension. Our
		  results disagree with previous findings. While we also
		  observe that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower
		  driving neutrino luminosity than spherically symmetric (1D)
		  models, we do not find that explosions in 3D occur easier
		  and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that the average
		  entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the
		  dimension and thus is not a good diagnostic quantity for
		  the readiness to explode. Instead, mass, integrated
		  entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and non-radial
		  kinetic energy in the gain layer are higher when models are
		  closer to explosion. Coherent, large-scale mass motions as
		  typically associated with the standing accretion-shock
		  instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for
		  explosions because they drive strong shock expansion and
		  thus enlarge the gain layer. While 2D models with better
		  angular resolution clearly explode more easily, the
		  opposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a
		  consequence of the turbulent energy cascade, which
		  transports energy from small to large spatial scales in 2D,
		  thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow
		  in 3D is in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation
		  and vortex motions on smaller scales and thus making the 3D
		  evolution with finer grid resolution more similar to 1D.
		  More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may
		  therefore be tightly linked to efficient growth of
		  low-order SASI modes including nonaxisymmetric ones.},

  Abstract	= {We explore the dependence on spatial dimension of the
		  viability of the neutrino heating mechanism of
		  core-collapse supernova explosions. We find that the
		  tendency to explode is a monotonically increasing function
		  of dimension, with three dimensions (3D) requiring ~40%-50%
		  lower driving neutrino luminosity than one dimension and
		  ~15%-25% lower driving neutrino luminosity than two
		  dimensions (2D). Moreover, we find that the delay to
		  explosion for a given neutrino luminosity is always shorter
		  in 3D than 2D, sometimes by many hundreds of milliseconds.
		  The magnitude of this dimensional effect is much larger
		  than the purported magnitude of a variety of other effects,
		  such as nuclear burning, inelastic scattering, or general
		  relativity, which are sometimes invoked to bridge the gap
		  between the current ambiguous and uncertain theoretical
		  situation and the fact of robust supernova explosions.
		  Since real supernovae occur in three dimensions, our
		  finding may be an important step toward unraveling one of
		  the most problematic puzzles in stellar astrophysics. In
		  addition, even though in 3D, we do see pre-explosion

  Abstract	= {During the stalled-shock phase of our three-dimensional,

		  energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport, the

		  predominantly in one hemisphere. This novel,
		  spherical-symmetry breaking neutrino-hydrodynamical
		  instability is termed LESA for "Lepton-number Emission
		  Self-sustained Asymmetry." While the individual nu e and
		  \bar{nu }_e fluxes show a pronounced dipole pattern, the
		  heavy-flavor neutrino fluxes and the overall luminosity are
		  almost spherically symmetric. Initially, LESA seems to
		  develop stochastically from convective fluctuations. It

		  during violent shock sloshing associated with the standing
		  accretion shock instability. The nu e minus \bar{nu }_e
		  flux asymmetry originates predominantly below the
		  neutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star
		  (PNS) convection, which is stronger in the hemisphere of
		  enhanced lepton-number flux. On this side of the PNS, the
		  mass accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,
		  amplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the
		  spherical stellar infall deflects on a dipolar deformation
		  of the stalled shock. The increased shock radius in the
		  hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number
		  flux (\bar{nu }_e flux maximum) is sustained by stronger
		  convection on this side, which is boosted by stronger
		  neutrino heating due to < epsilo \bar{nu _e}> \gt < epsilo
		  nu _e>. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global
		  deformation despite extremely nonstationary convective
		  overturn behind the shock. While these different elements

  Abstract	= {We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of

		  detailed analysis of the energetic aspects of
		  neutrino-powered supernova explosions. Our results confirm
		  that the neutrino-heating mechanism remains a viable
		  explanation of the explosion of a wider mass range of
		  supernova progenitors with iron cores, but the explosion
		  sets in later and develops differently than thought so far.
		  The calculations were performed with an energy-dependent
		  treatment of the neutrino transport based on the
		  "ray-by-ray plus" approximation, in which the neutrino
		  number, energy, and momentum equations are closed with a
		  variable Eddington factor obtained by iteratively solving a
		  model Boltzmann equation. We focus here on the evolution of
		  a 15 M sun progenitor and provide evidence that shock
		  revival and an explosion are initiated at about 600 ms
		  after core bounce, powered by neutrino energy deposition.
		  This is significantly later than previously found for an
		  11.2 M sun star, for which we also present a continuation
		  of the explosion model published by Buras et al. The onset
		  of the blast is fostered in both cases by the standing
		  accretion-shock instability. This instability exhibits
		  highest growth rates for the dipole and quadrupole modes,
		  which lead to large-amplitude bipolar shock oscillations
		  and push the shock to larger radii, thus increasing the
		  time accreted matter is exposed to neutrino heating in the
		  gain layer. As a consequence, also convective overturn
		  behind the shock is strengthened, which otherwise is
		  suppressed or damped because of the small shock stagnation
		  radius. When the explosion sets in, the shock reveals a
		  pronounced global deformation with a dominant dipolar
		  component. In both the 11.2 M sun and 15 M sun explosions
		  long-lasting equatorial downflows supply the gain layer
		  with fresh gas, of which a sizable fraction is heated by
		  neutrinos and leads to the build-up of the explosion energy
		  of the ejecta over possibly hundreds of milliseconds. A
		  "soft" nuclear equation of state that causes a rapid
		  contraction, and a smaller radius of the forming neutron
		  star and thus a fast release of gravitational binding
		  energy, seems to be more favorable for the development of
		  an explosion. Rotation has the opposite effect because in
		  the long run it leads to a more extended and cooler neutron
		  star and thus lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies
		  and overall less neutrino heating. Neutron star g-mode
		  oscillations, although we see their presence, and the
		  acoustic mechanism play no important role in our
		  simulations. While numerical tests show that our code is
		  also well able to follow large-amplitude core g-modes if
		  they are instigated; the amplitude of such oscillations
		  remains small in our supernova runs and the acoustic energy
		  flux injected by the ringing neutron star and by the
		  deceleration of supersonic downflows near the neutron star
		  surface is small compared to the neutrino energy
		  deposition.},

  Abstract	= {The relevance of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI) compared to neutrino-driven convection in
		  three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core environments is still
		  highly controversial. Studying a 27 M &sun; progenitor, we
		  demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity
		  can develop in 3D simulations with detailed neutrino
		  transport despite the presence of convection. This result
		  was obtained with the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code with the same
		  sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in
		  one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) models. While
		  buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass
		  motions in the postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with
		  growing amplitude sets in during a phase of shock
		  retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose
		  growth is only quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO
		  interface leads to strong shock expansion in response to a
		  dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the phase
		  of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the
		  postshock layer exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by
		  the lowest-order spherical harmonics (l = 1, m = 0, $\pm$1)
		  in distinct contrast to the higher multipole structures
		  associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that
		  the SASI amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic

  Abstract	= {We present numerical results on two- (2D) and
		  three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic core-collapse
		  simulations of an 11.2 M &sun; star. By changing numerical
		  resolutions and seed perturbations systematically, we study
		  how the postbounce dynamics are different in 2D and 3D. The
		  calculations were performed with an energy-dependent
		  treatment of the neutrino transport based on the isotropic
		  diffusion source approximation scheme, which we have
		  updated to achieve a very high computational efficiency.
		  All of the computed models in this work, including nine 3D
		  models and fifteen 2D models, exhibit the revival of the
		  stalled bounce shock, leading to the possibility of
		  explosion. All of them are driven by the neutrino-heating
		  mechanism, which is fostered by neutrino-driven convection
		  and the standing-accretion-shock instability. Reflecting
		  the stochastic nature of multi-dimensional (multi-D)
		  neutrino-driven explosions, the blast morphology changes
		  from model to model. However, we find that the final fate
		  of the multi-D models, whether an explosion is obtained or
		  not, is little affected by the explosion stochasticity. In
		  agreement with some previous studies, higher numerical
		  resolutions lead to slower onset of the shock revival in
		  both 2D and 3D. Based on the self-consistent supernova
		  models leading to the possibility of explosions, our
		  results systematically show that the revived shock expands
		  more energetically in 2D than in 3D.},

  Abstract	= {We investigate the effects of neutrino heating and
		  alpha-particle recombination on the hydrodynamics of
		  core-collapse supernovae. Our focus is on the nonlinear
		  dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse and
		  the assembly of positive energy material below it. To this
		  end, we perform time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations
		  with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial symmetry. These
		  generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk
		  neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium
		  between n, p, and alpha. The heating rate is freely
		  tunable, as is the starting radius of the shock relative to
		  the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion
		  in spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an
		  overstable mode, which may be viewed as the ell = 0 version
		  of the "Standing Accretion Shock Instability." In
		  two-dimensional simulations, nonspherical deformations of
		  the shock are driven by plumes of material with positive
		  Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside
		  the zone of strong neutrino heating. The nonspherical modes
		  of the shock reach a large amplitude only when the heating
		  rate is also high enough to excite convection below the
		  shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion
		  depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock
		  relative to the recombination radius. Weaker heating is
		  required to drive an explosion in two dimensions than in
		  one, but the difference also depends on the size of the
		  shock. Forcing the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into
		  n and p below the shock only causes a slight increase in
		  the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts out
		  at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or
		  some other mechanism) must play a significant role in
		  pushing the shock far enough out that recombination heating
		  takes over.},

  Abstract	= {We present one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and
		  three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of
		  core-collapse supernovae including a parameterized neutrino
		  heating and cooling scheme in order to investigate the
		  critical core neutrino luminosity (L crit) required for
		  explosion. In contrast to some previous works, we find that
		  3D simulations explode later than 2D simulations, and that
		  L crit at fixed mass accretion rate is somewhat higher in
		  three dimensions than in two dimensions. We find, however,
		  that in two dimensions L crit increases as the numerical
		  resolution of the simulation increases. In contrast to some
		  previous works, we argue that the average entropy of the
		  gain region is in fact not a good indicator of explosion
		  but is rather a reflection of the greater mass in the gain
		  region in two dimensions. We compare our simulations to
		  semi-analytic explosion criteria and examine the nature of
		  the convective motions in two dimensions and three
		  dimensions. We discuss the balance between neutrino-driven
		  buoyancy and drag forces. In particular, we show that the
		  drag force will be proportional to a buoyant plume's
		  surface area while the buoyant force is proportional to a
		  plume's volume and, therefore, plumes with greater
		  volume-to-surface-area ratios will rise more quickly. We
		  show that buoyant plumes in two dimensions are inherently
		  larger, with greater volume-to-surface-area ratios, than
		  plumes in three dimensions. In the scenario that the
		  supernova shock expansion is dominated by neutrino-driven
		  buoyancy, this balance between buoyancy and drag forces may
		  explain why 3D simulations explode later than 2D
		  simulations and why L crit increases with resolution.
		  Finally, we provide a comparison of our results with other
		  calculations in the literature.},

  Abstract	= {We describe the results of 3D numerical simulations of
		  oxygen shell burning and hydrogen core burning in a 23
		  Msolar stellar model. A detailed comparison is made to
		  stellar mixing-length theory (MLT) for the shell-burning
		  model. Simulations in 2D are significantly different from
		  3D, in terms of both flow morphology and velocity
		  amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted
		  using a dynamic boundary condition based on the bulk
		  Richardson number than by purely local, static criteria
		  like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description
		  of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for shell
		  convection; however, there are other important effects that
		  it does not capture, mostly related to the dynamical motion
		  of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective
		  regions. There is asymmetry between upflows and downflows,
		  so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero. The motion of
		  convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves; this is
		  a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective
		  plumes. Convective ``overshooting'' is best described as an
		  elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than
		  ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent
		  eddies. The convective boundaries are rife with internal

		  give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
		  (typically 1.2 × 1051 ergs), and the explosive

		  likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience
		  considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the
		  initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions
		  will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light
		  curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have
		  dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
		  black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The

		  collapse (in ~1 hr in one dimension (1D)), with
		  simultaneously active C, Ne, O, and Si burning shells, are

		  forced to be quasi-static). Pronounced asymmetries and
		  strong dynamical interactions between shells are seen in
		  2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior
		  proceeds to sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples
		  to the nuclear burning. Dramatic growth of low-order modes
		  is seen as well as large deviations from spherical symmetry

  Abstract	= {We present the new open-source spherically symmetric
		  general-relativistic (GR) hydrodynamics code GR1D. It is
		  based on the Eulerian formulation of GR hydrodynamics
		  (GRHD) put forth by Romero-Ib{\'a}{\~n}ez-Gourgoulhon and
		  employs radial-gauge, polar-slicing coordinates in which
		  the 3+1 equations simplify substantially. We discretize the
		  GRHD equations with a finite-volume scheme, employing
		  piecewise-parabolic reconstruction and an approximate
		  Riemann solver. GR1D is intended for the simulation of
		  stellar collapse to neutron stars and black holes and will
		  also serve as a testbed for modeling technology to be
		  incorporated in multi-D GR codes. Its GRHD part is coupled
		  to various finite-temperature microphysical equations of
		  state in tabulated form that we make available with GR1D.
		  An approximate deleptonization scheme for the collapse
		  phase and a neutrino-leakage/heating scheme for the
		  postbounce epoch are included and described. We also derive
		  the equations for effective rotation in 1D and implement
		  them in GR1D. We present an array of standard test
		  calculations and also show how simple analytic equations of
		  state in combination with presupernova models from stellar
		  evolutionary calculations can be used to study qualitative
		  aspects of black hole formation in failing rotating
		  core-collapse supernovae. In addition, we present a
		  simulation with microphysical equations of state and
		  neutrino leakage/heating of a failing core-collapse
		  supernova and black hole formation in a presupernova model
		  of a 40 Modot zero-age main-sequence star. We find good
		  agreement on the time of black hole formation (within 20%)
		  and last stable protoneutron star mass (within 10%) with

  Abstract	= {We perform axisymmetric (2D) multiangle, multigroup
		  neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic calculations of the
		  postbounce phase of core-collapse supernovae using a
		  genuinely 2D discrete-ordinate (Sn) method. We follow the
		  long-term postbounce evolution of the cores of one
		  nonrotating and one rapidly rotating 20 Msolar stellar
		  model for ~400 milliseconds from 160 to ~550 ms after
		  bounce. We present a multidimensional analysis of the
		  multiangle neutrino radiation fields and compare in detail
		  with counterpart simulations carried out in the 2D
		  multigroup flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) approximation to
		  neutrino transport. We find that 2D multiangle transport is
		  superior in capturing the global and local radiation-field
		  variations associated with rotation-induced and
		  SASI-induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations. In the
		  rotating model, multiangle transport predicts much larger
		  asymptotic neutrino flux asymmetries with pole-to-equator
		  ratios of up to ~2.5, while MGFLD tends to sphericize the
		  radiation fields already in the optically semitransparent
		  postshock regions. Along the poles, the multiangle
		  calculation predicts a dramatic enhancement of the neutrino
		  heating by up to a factor of 3, which alters the postbounce
		  evolution and results in greater polar shock radii and an
		  earlier onset of the initially rotationally weakened SASI.
		  In the nonrotating model, differences between multiangle
		  and MGFLD calculations remain small at early times when the
		  postshock region does not depart significantly from
		  spherical symmetry. At later times, however, the growing
		  SASI leads to large-scale asymmetries and the multiangle
		  calculation predicts up to 30% higher average integral
		  neutrino energy deposition rates than MGFLD.},

  Abstract	= {The effect of rotation on the explosion of core-collapse
		  supernovae is investigated systematically in
		  three-dimensional simulations. In order to obtain the
		  critical conditions for explosion as a function of mass
		  accretion rate, neutrino luminosity, and specific angular
		  momentum, rigidly rotating matter was injected from the
		  outer boundary with an angular momentum, which is increased
		  every 500 ms. It is found that there is a critical value of
		  the specific angular momentum, above which the standing
		  shock wave revives, for a given combination of mass
		  accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e., an explosion
		  can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is
		  lower than the critical value for a given mass accretion
		  rate in non-rotational models. The coupling of rotation and
		  hydrodynamical instabilities plays an important role in
		  characterizing the dynamics of shock revival for the range
		  of specific angular momentum that are supposed to be
		  realistic. Contrary to expectations from past studies, the
		  most rapidly expanding direction of the shock wave is not
		  aligned with the rotation axis. Being perpendicular to the
		  rotation axis on average, it can be oriented in various
		  directions. Its dispersion is small when the spiral mode of
		  the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) governs the
		  dynamics, while it is large when neutrino-driven convection
		  is dominant. As a result of the comparison between
		  two-dimensional and three-dimensional rotational models, it
		  is found that m != 0 modes of neutrino-driven convection or
		  SASI are important for shock revival around the critical

  Abstract	= {Simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) result in
		  successful explosions once the neutrino luminosity exceeds
		  a critical curve, and recent simulations indicate that
		  turbulence further enables explosion by reducing this
		  critical neutrino luminosity. We propose a theoretical
		  framework to derive this result and take the first steps by
		  deriving the governing mean-field equations. Using Reynolds
		  decomposition, we decompose flow variables into background
		  and turbulent flows and derive self-consistent averaged
		  equations for their evolution. As basic requirements for
		  the CCSN problem, these equations naturally incorporate
		  steady-state accretion, neutrino heating and cooling,
		  non-zero entropy gradients, and turbulence terms associated
		  with buoyant driving, redistribution, and dissipation.
		  Furthermore, analysis of two-dimensional (2D) CCSN
		  simulations validate these Reynolds-averaged equations, and
		  we show that the physics of turbulence entirely accounts
		  for the differences between 1D and 2D CCSN simulations. As
		  a prelude to deriving the reduction in the critical
		  luminosity, we identify the turbulent terms that most
		  influence the conditions for explosion. Generically,
		  turbulence equations require closure models, but these
		  closure models depend upon the macroscopic properties of
		  the flow. To derive a closure model that is appropriate for
		  CCSNe, we cull the literature for relevant closure models
		  and compare each with 2D simulations. These models employ
		  local closure approximations and fail to reproduce the
		  global properties of neutrino-driven turbulence. Motivated
		  by the generic failure of these local models, we propose an
		  original model for turbulence which incorporates global
		  properties of the flow. This global model accurately
		  reproduces the turbulence profiles and evolution of 2D CCSN

  Abstract	= {We have conducted a series of numerical experiments with
		  the spherically symmetric, general relativistic, neutrino
		  radiation hydrodynamics code AGILE-BOLTZTRAN to examine the
		  effects of several approximations used in multidimensional
		  core-collapse supernova simulations. Our code permits us to
		  examine the effects of these approximations quantitatively
		  by removing, or substituting for, the pieces of supernova
		  physics of interest. These approximations include: (1)
		  using Newtonian versus general relativistic gravity,
		  hydrodynamics, and transport; (2) using a reduced set of
		  weak interactions, including the omission of
		  non-isoenergetic neutrino scattering, versus the current
		  state-of-the-art; and (3) omitting the velocity-dependent
		  terms, or observer corrections, from the neutrino Boltzmann
		  kinetic equation. We demonstrate that each of these changes
		  has noticeable effects on the outcomes of our simulations.
		  Of these, we find that the omission of observer corrections
		  is particularly detrimental to the potential for
		  neutrino-driven explosions and exhibits a failure to
		  conserve lepton number. Finally, we discuss the impact of
		  these results on our understanding of current, and the

  Abstract	= {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most fascinating
		  phenomena in astrophysics and provide a formidable
		  challenge for theoretical investigation. They mark the
		  spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an
		  explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun
		  produces during its whole life. A better understanding of
		  the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth sites of
		  neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements,
		  and more reliable predictions of the observable signals
		  from stellar death events are tightly linked to the
		  solution of the long-standing puzzle of how collapsing
		  stars achieve explosion. In this article our current
		  knowledge of the processes that contribute to the success
		  of the explosion mechanism is concisely reviewed. After a
		  short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar
		  core-collapse events, the general properties of
		  progenitor-dependent neutrino emission will be briefly
		  described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in
		  axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as
		  well as in simulations with an approximate treatment of
		  relativistic effects, we can find successful
		  neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor
		  stars. The first results of three-dimensional (3D) models
		  have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic simulations
		  demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the
		  pre-collapse core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered
		  supernova explosions even in nonrotating stars. These
		  results are discussed in the context of the present
		  controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring
		  the supernova mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and
		  they are interpreted against the background of the current
		  disagreement on the question of whether the standing
		  accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven
		  convection is the crucial agency that supports the onset of
		  the explosion.},

  Abstract	= {In this paper, we describe a new hydrodynamics code for
		  one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) astrophysical
		  simulations, BETHE-hydro, that uses time-dependent,
		  arbitrary, unstructured grids. The core of the
		  hydrodynamics algorithm is an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
		  (ALE) approach, in which the gradient and divergence
		  operators are made compatible using the support-operator
		  method. We present 1D and 2D gravity solvers that are
		  finite differenced using the support-operator technique,
		  and the resulting system of linear equations are solved
		  using the tridiagonal method for 1D simulations and an
		  iterative multigrid-preconditioned conjugate-gradient
		  method for 2D simulations. Rotational terms are included
		  for 2D calculations using cylindrical coordinates. We
		  document an incompatibility between a subcell pressure
		  algorithm to suppress hourglass motions, and the subcell
		  remapping algorithm and present a modified subcell pressure
		  scheme that avoids this problem. Strengths of this code
		  include a straightforward structure, enabling simple
		  inclusion of additional physics packages, the ability to
		  use a general equation of state, and most importantly, the
		  ability to solve self-gravitating hydrodynamic flows on
		  time-dependent, arbitrary grids. In what follows, we
		  describe in detail the numerical techniques employed and,
		  with a large suite of tests, demonstrate that BETHE-hydro
		  finds accurate solutions with second-order convergence.},

  Abstract	= {The neutrino-heated "gain layer" immediately behind the
		  stalled shock in a core-collapse supernova is unstable to
		  high-Reynolds-number turbulent convection. We carry out and
		  analyze a new set of 19 high-resolution three-dimensional
		  (3D) simulations with a three-species neutrino
		  leakage/heating scheme and compare with spherically
		  symmetric (one-dimensional, 1D) and axisymmetric
		  (two-dimensional, 2D) simulations carried out with the same
		  methods. We study the postbounce supernova evolution in a
		  15 M &sun; progenitor star and vary the local neutrino
		  heating rate, the magnitude and spatial dependence of
		  asphericity from convective burning in the Si/O shell, and
		  spatial resolution. Our simulations suggest that there is a
		  direct correlation between the strength of turbulence in
		  the gain layer and the susceptibility to explosion. 2D and
		  3D simulations explode at much lower neutrino heating rates
		  than 1D simulations. This is commonly explained by the fact
		  that nonradial dynamics allows accreting material to stay
		  longer in the gain layer. We show that this explanation is
		  incomplete. Our results indicate that the effective
		  turbulent ram pressure exerted on the shock plays a crucial
		  role by allowing multi-dimensional models to explode at a
		  lower postshock thermal pressure and thus with less
		  neutrino heating than 1D models. We connect the turbulent
		  ram pressure with turbulent energy at large scales and in
		  this way explain why 2D simulations are erroneously
		  exploding more easily than 3D simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We present new two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric neutrino
		  radiation/hydrodynamic models of core-collapse supernova
		  (CCSN) cores. We use the CASTRO code, which incorporates
		  truly multi-dimensional, multi-group, flux-limited
		  diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all
		  relevant {O}(v/c) terms. Our main motivation for carrying
		  out this study is to compare with recent 2D models produced
		  by other groups who have obtained explosions for some
		  progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN results that did
		  not incorporate {O}(v/c) terms. We follow the evolution of
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately
		  600 ms after bounce and do not obtain an explosion in any
		  of these models. Though the reason for the qualitative
		  disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
		  remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying
		  "ray-by-ray" approach employed by all other groups may be
		  compromising their results. We show that "ray-by-ray"
		  calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
		  variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are
		  better captured by our multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On
		  the other hand, our 2D models also make approximations,
		  making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
		  concerning the root of the differences between groups. We
		  discuss some of the diagnostics often employed in the
		  analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
		  relationship between the various explosion conditions that
		  have been proposed. Finally, we explore the ingredients
		  that may be missing in current calculations that may be
		  important in reproducing the properties of the average
		  CCSNe, should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the
		  correct mechanism of explosion.},
