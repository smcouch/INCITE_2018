  Abstract	= {We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations initiated from 12, 15, 20, and 25
		  {M}&sun; zero-age main sequence progenitors. All of the
		  simulations yield explosions and have been evolved for at
		  least 1.2 s after core bounce and 1 s after material first
		  becomes unbound. These simulations were computed with our
		  Chimera code employing RbR spectral neutrino transport,
		  special and general relativistic transport effects, and
		  state-of-the-art neutrino interactions. Continuing the
		  evolution beyond 1 s after core bounce allows the
		  explosions to develop more fully and the processes involved
		  in powering the explosions to become more clearly evident.
		  We compute explosion energy estimates, including the
		  negative gravitational binding energy of the stellar
		  envelope outside the expanding shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38,
		  and 0.70 Bethe (B ≡ {10}51 erg) and increasing at 0.03,
		  0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 {\text{B s}}-1, respectively, for the
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 {M}&sun; models at the endpoint of this
		  report. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in
		  our models through detailed analyses of the energy sources
		  and flows. We discuss how the explosion energies may be
		  subject to stochastic variations as exemplfied by the
		  effect of the explosion geometry of the 20 {M}&sun; model
		  in reducing its explosion energy. We compute the
		  proto-neutron star masses and kick velocities. We compare
		  our results for the explosion energies and ejected {}56{Ni}
		  masses against some observational standards despite the
		  large error bars in both models and observations.},

  Abstract	= {We present a new multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics
		  code for massive stellar core-collapse in full general
		  relativity (GR). Employing an M1 analytical closure scheme,
		  we solve spectral neutrino transport of the radiation
		  energy and momentum based on a truncated moment formalism.
		  Regarding neutrino opacities, we take into account a
		  baseline set in state-of-the-art simulations, in which
		  inelastic neutrino-electron scattering, thermal neutrino
		  production via pair annihilation, and nucleon-nucleon
		  bremsstrahlung are included. While the Einstein field
		  equations and the spatial advection terms in the
		  radiation-hydrodynamics equations are evolved explicitly,
		  the source terms due to neutrino-matter interactions and
		  energy shift in the radiation moment equations are
		  integrated implicitly by an iteration method. To verify our
		  code, we first perform a series of standard radiation tests
		  with analytical solutions that include the check of
		  gravitational redshift and Doppler shift. A good agreement
		  in these tests supports the reliability of the GR
		  multi-energy neutrino transport scheme. We then conduct
		  several test simulations of core-collapse, bounce, and
		  shock stall of a 15{M}&sun; star in the Cartesian
		  coordinates and make a detailed comparison with published
		  results. Our code performs quite well to reproduce the
		  results of full Boltzmann neutrino transport especially
		  before bounce. In the postbounce phase, our code basically
		  performs well, however, there are several differences that
		  are most likely to come from the insufficient spatial
		  resolution in our current 3D-GR models. For clarifying the
		  resolution dependence and extending the code comparison in
		  the late postbounce phase, we discuss that next-generation
		  Exaflops class supercomputers are needed at least.},

  Abstract	= {We present the new code ALCAR developed to model
		  multidimensional, multienergy-group neutrino transport in
		  the context of supernovae and neutron-star mergers. The
		  algorithm solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and
		  first-order angular moments of the specific intensity,
		  supplemented by an algebraic relation for the second-moment
		  tensor to close the system. The scheme takes into account
		  frame-dependent effects of the order O(v/c) as well as the
		  most important types of neutrino interactions. The
		  transport scheme is significantly more efficient than a
		  multidimensional solver of the Boltzmann equation, while it
		  is more accurate and consistent than the flux-limited
		  diffusion method. The finite-volume discretization of the
		  essentially hyperbolic system of moment equations employs
		  methods well-known from hydrodynamics. For the time
		  integration of the potentially stiff moment equations we
		  employ a scheme in which only the local source terms are
		  treated implicitly, while the advection terms are kept
		  explicit, thereby allowing for an efficient computational
		  parallelization of the algorithm. We investigate various
		  problem set-ups in one and two dimensions to verify the
		  implementation and to test the quality of the algebraic
		  closure scheme. In our most detailed test, we compare a
		  fully dynamic, one-dimensional core-collapse simulation
		  with two published calculations performed with well-known
		  Boltzmann-type neutrino-hydrodynamics codes and we find
		  very satisfactory agreement.},

  Abstract	= {We perform the first self-consistent, time-dependent,

		  the consequences of using the ray-by-ray+ transport
		  simplification in core-collapse supernova simulations. Such
		  a dimensional reduction is employed by many researchers to
		  facilitate their resource-intensive calculations. Our new
		  code (Fornax) implements multi-D transport, and can, by
		  zeroing out transverse flux terms, emulate the ray-by-ray+
		  scheme. Using the same microphysics, initial models,
		  resolution, and code, we compare the results of simulating
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 M &sun; progenitor models using these
		  two transport methods. Our findings call into question the
		  wisdom of the pervasive use of the ray-by-ray+ approach.
		  Employing it leads to maximum post-bounce/pre-explosion
		  shock radii that are almost universally larger by tens of
		  kilometers than those derived using the more accurate
		  scheme, typically leaving the post-bounce matter less bound
		  and artificially more ``explodable.'' In fact, for our 25 M
		  &sun; progenitor, the ray-by-ray+ model explodes, while the
		  corresponding multi-D transport model does not. Therefore,
		  in two dimensions, the combination of ray-by-ray+ with the
		  axial sloshing hydrodynamics that is a feature of 2D
		  supernova dynamics can result in quantitatively, and
		  perhaps qualitatively, incorrect results.},

  Abstract	= {Carefully accounting for neutrino transport is an
		  essential component of many astrophysical studies. Solving
		  the full transport equation is too expensive for most
		  realistic applications, especially those involving multiple
		  spatial dimensions. For such cases, resorting to
		  approximations is often the only viable option for
		  obtaining solutions. One such approximation, which recently
		  became popular, is the M1 method. It utilizes the system of
		  the lowest two moments of the transport equation and closes
		  the system with an ad hoc closure relation. The accuracy of
		  the M1 solution depends on the quality of the closure.
		  Several closures have been proposed in the literature and
		  have been used in various studies. We carry out an
		  extensive study of these closures by comparing the results
		  of M1 calculations with precise Monte Carlo calculations of
		  the radiation field around spherically-symmetric
		  protoneutron star models. We find that no closure performs
		  consistently better or worse than others in all cases. The
		  level of accuracy a given closure yields depends on the
		  matter configuration, neutrino type, and neutrino energy.
		  Given this limitation, the maximum entropy closure by
		  Minerbo (1978) on average yields relatively accurate
		  results in the broadest set of cases considered in this
		  work.},

  Abstract	= {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate
		  Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
		  equations is developed based on the assumption that the
		  normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This
		  assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes
		  Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler
		  equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived
		  that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate
		  states for Bx != 0, whereas the number of the intermediate
		  states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the
		  intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in
		  this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained,
		  the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed
		  straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly
		  resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system,
		  and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands
		  for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that
		  the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the
		  HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver
		  corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic
		  field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD
		  Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the
		  linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally
		  good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in
		  practical applications for the ideal MHD equations.},

		  technique can be easily implemented in any existing code
		  since there is no need to modify the solver for the MHD
		  equations. It is based on a modified system in which the
		  divergence constraint is coupled with the conservation laws
		  by introducing a generalized Lagrange multiplier. We
		  suggest a formulation in which the divergence errors are
		  transported to the domain boundaries with the maximal
		  admissible speed and are damped at the same time. This
		  corrected system is hyperbolic and the density, momentum,
		  magnetic induction, and total energy density are still
		  conserved. In comparison to results obtained without
		  correction or with the standard ``divergence source
		  terms,'' our approach seems to yield more robust schemes
		  with significantly smaller divergence errors.},

  Abstract	= {We present a high-order accurate weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference scheme for solving
		  the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This
		  scheme is a direct extension of a WENO scheme, which has
		  been successfully applied to hydrodynamic problems. The
		  WENO scheme follows the same idea of an essentially
		  non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme with an advantage of achieving
		  higher-order accuracy with fewer computations. Both ENO and
		  WENO can be easily applied to two and three spatial
		  dimensions by evaluating the fluxes dimension-by-dimension.
		  Details of the WENO scheme as well as the construction of a
		  suitable eigen-system, which can properly decompose various
		  families of MHD waves and handle the degenerate situations,
		  are presented. Numerical results are shown to perform well
		  for the one-dimensional Brio-Wu Riemann problems, the
		  two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problems, and
		  the two-dimensional Orszag-Tang MHD vortex system. They
		  also demonstrate the importance of maintaining the
		  divergence free condition for the magnetic field in
		  achieving numerical stability. The tests also show the
		  advantages of using the higher-order scheme. The new
		  5th-order WENO MHD code can attain an accuracy comparable
		  with that of the second-order schemes with many fewer grid

  Abstract	= {We present and compare third- as well as fifth-order
		  accurate finite difference schemes for the numerical
		  solution of the compressible ideal MHD equations in
		  multiple spatial dimensions. The selected methods lean on
		  four different reconstruction techniques based on recently
		  improved versions of the weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving
		  (MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial
		  reconstruction. The proposed numerical methods are highly
		  accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss of
		  accuracy in proximity of smooth extrema and provide sharp
		  non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities. We suggest
		  a numerical formulation based on a cell-centered approach
		  where all of the primary flow variables are discretized at
		  the zone center. The divergence-free condition is enforced
		  by augmenting the MHD equations with a generalized Lagrange
		  multiplier yielding a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic
		  correction, as in Dedner et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 175
		  (2002) 645-673]. The resulting family of schemes is robust,
		  cost-effective and straightforward to implement. Compared
		  to previous existing approaches, it completely avoids the
		  CPU intensive workload associated with an elliptic

		  required by staggered mesh algorithms. Extensive numerical
		  testing demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the
		  proposed framework for computations involving both smooth

  Abstract	= {We present self-consistent, axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations performed with the Prometheus-Vertex
		  code for 18 pre-supernova models in the range of 11-28 M
		  &sun;, including progenitors recently investigated by other
		  groups. All models develop explosions, but depending on the
		  progenitor structure, they can be divided into two classes.
		  With a steep density decline at the Si/Si-O interface, the
		  arrival of this interface at the shock front leads to a
		  sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid
		  approach to explosion. With a more gradually decreasing
		  accretion rate, it takes longer for the neutrino heating to
		  overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions set in
		  later. Early explosions are facilitated by high
		  mass-accretion rates after bounce and correspondingly high
		  neutrino luminosities combined with a pronounced drop of
		  the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O
		  interface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii
		  and receding shock fronts after the passage through their
		  maxima, our models exhibit short advection timescales,
		  which favor the efficient growth of the standing
		  accretion-shock instability. The latter plays a supportive
		  role at least for the initiation of the re-expansion of the
		  stalled shock before runaway. Taking into account the
		  effects of turbulent pressure in the gain layer, we derive
		  a generalized condition for the critical neutrino
		  luminosity that captures the explosion behavior of all
		  models very well. We validate the robustness of our
		  findings by testing the influence of stochasticity,
		  numerical resolution, and approximations in some aspects of
		  the microphysics.},

  Abstract	= {We propose a simple ansatz for estimating the value of the
		  numerical resistivity and the numerical viscosity of any
		  Eulerian MHD code. We test this ansatz with the help of
		  simulations of the propagation of (magneto)sonic waves,
		  Alfven waves, and the tearing mode instability using the
		  MHD code Aenus. By comparing the simu- lation results with
		  analytical solutions of the resistive-viscous MHD equations
		  and an empirical ansatz for the growth rate of tearing
		  modes we measure the numerical viscosity and resistivity of
		  Aenus. The comparison shows that the fast-magnetosonic
		  speed and wavelength are the characteristic velocity and
		  length, respectively, of the aforementioned (relatively
		  simple) systems. We also determine the dependance of the
		  numerical viscosity and resistivity on the time integration
		  method, the spatial reconstruction scheme and (to a lesser
		  extent) the Riemann solver employed in the simulations.
		  From the measured results we infer the numerical resolution
		  (as a function of the spatial reconstruction method)
		  required to properly resolve the growth and saturation
		  level of the magnetic field amplified by the
		  magnetorotational instability in the post-collapsed core of
		  massive stars. Our results show that it is to the best
		  advantage to resort to ultra-high order methods (e.g.,
		  9th-order Monotonicity Preserving method) to tackle this
		  problem properly, in particular in three dimensional
		  simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We introduce an unsplit staggered mesh scheme (USM) for
		  multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that uses a
		  constrained transport (CT) method with high-order Godunov
		  fluxes and incorporates a new data reconstruction-evolution
		  algorithm for second-order MHD interface states. In this
		  new algorithm, the USM scheme includes so-called
		  "multidimensional MHD terms", proportional to ∇·B, in a
		  dimensionally-unsplit way in a single update. This data
		  reconstruction-evolution step, extended from the corner
		  transport upwind (CTU) approach of Colella, maintains
		  in-plane dynamics very well, as shown by the advection of a
		  very weak magnetic field loop in 2D. This data
		  reconstruction-evolution algorithm is also of advantage in
		  its consistency and simplicity when extended to 3D. The
		  scheme maintains the ∇·B=0 constraint by solving a set
		  of discrete induction equations using the standard CT
		  approach, where the accuracy of the computed electric field
		  directly influences the quality of the magnetic field
		  solution. We address the lack of proper dissipative
		  behavior in the simple electric field averaging scheme and
		  present a new modified electric field construction (MEC)
		  that includes multidimensional derivative information and
		  enhances solution accuracy. A series of comparison studies
		  demonstrates the excellent performance of the full USM-MEC
		  scheme for many stringent multidimensional MHD test
		  problems chosen from the literature. The scheme is
		  implemented and currently freely available in the
		  University of Chicago ASC FLASH Center's FLASH3 release.},

  Abstract	= {We describe a single step, second-order accurate Godunov
		  scheme for ideal MHD based on combining the piecewise
		  parabolic method (PPM) for performing spatial
		  reconstruction, the corner transport upwind (CTU) method of
		  Colella for multidimensional integration, and the
		  constrained transport (CT) algorithm for preserving the
		  divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. We adopt
		  the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be
		  represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate
		  that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can
		  be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged
		  field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain
		  simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive
		  new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell
		  corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent
		  one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned
		  flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must
		  include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a
		  number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in
		  order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the
		  results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the

  Abstract	= {In this article we develop an improved version of the
		  classical fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory
		  finite difference scheme of [G.S. Jiang, C.W. Shu,
		  Efficient implementation of weighted ENO schemes, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 126 (1996) 202-228] (WENO-JS) for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws. Through the novel use of a linear
		  combination of the low order smoothness indicators already
		  present in the framework of WENO-JS, a new smoothness
		  indicator of higher order is devised and new
		  non-oscillatory weights are built, providing a new WENO
		  scheme (WENO-Z) with less dissipation and higher resolution
		  than the classical WENO. This new scheme generates
		  solutions that are sharp as the ones of the mapped WENO
		  scheme (WENO-M) of Henrick et al. [A.K. Henrick, T.D.
		  Aslam, J.M. Powers, Mapped weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory schemes: achieving optimal order near
		  critical points, J. Comput. Phys. 207 (2005) 542-567],
		  however with a 25% reduction in CPU costs, since no mapping
		  is necessary. We also provide a detailed analysis of the
		  convergence of the WENO-Z scheme at critical points of
		  smooth solutions and show that the solution enhancements of
		  WENO-Z and WENO-M at problems with shocks comes from their
		  ability to assign substantially larger weights to
		  discontinuous stencils than the WENO-JS scheme, not from
		  their superior order of convergence at critical points.
		  Numerical solutions of the linear advection of
		  discontinuous functions and nonlinear hyperbolic
		  conservation laws as the one dimensional Euler equations
		  with Riemann initial value problems, the Mach 3
		  shock-density wave interaction and the blastwave problems
		  are compared with the ones generated by the WENO-JS and
		  WENO-M schemes. The good performance of the WENO-Z scheme
		  is also demonstrated in the simulation of two dimensional
		  problems as the shock-vortex interaction and a Mach 4.46
		  Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI) modeled via the two
		  dimensional Euler equations.},

@Article{	  janka:2016,
  Abstract	= {Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of
		  core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities
		  play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. The first
		  successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained
		  with self-consistent, first-principles simulations in three
		  spatial dimensions. But three-dimensional (3D) models tend
		  to be less prone to explosion than the corresponding
		  axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) ones. The reason is that
		  3D turbulence leads to energy cascading from large to small
		  spatial scales, the inverse of the 2D case, thus
		  disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest
		  scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a
		  lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, some
		  important component of robust and sufficiently energetic
		  neutrino-powered explosions may still be missing. Such a
		  deficit could be associated with progenitor properties such
		  as rotation, magnetic fields, or precollapse perturbations,
		  or with microphysics that could cause enhancement of
		  neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also
		  revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D ones,
		  such as spiral modes of the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-number
		  emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time-
		  and direction-dependent variations on the detectable
		  neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of
		  their consequences is still in its infancy.},

  Abstract	= {In this paper, we extend the unsplit staggered mesh scheme
		  (USM) for 2D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [D. Lee, A.E.
		  Deane, An unsplit staggered mesh scheme for
		  multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 228
		  (2009) 952-975] to a full 3D MHD scheme. The scheme is a
		  finite-volume Godunov method consisting of a constrained
		  transport (CT) method and an efficient and accurate
		  single-step, directionally unsplit multidimensional data
		  reconstruction-evolution algorithm, which extends Colella's
		  original 2D corner transport upwind (CTU) method [P.
		  Colella, Multidimensional upwind methods for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 87 (1990) 446-466]. We
		  present two types of data reconstruction-evolution
		  algorithms for 3D: (1) a reduced CTU scheme and (2) a full
		  CTU scheme. The reduced 3D CTU scheme is a variant of a
		  simple 3D extension of Collela's 2D CTU method and is
		  considered as a direct extension from the 2D USM scheme.
		  The full 3D CTU scheme is our primary 3D solver which
		  includes all multidimensional cross-derivative terms for
		  stability. The latter method is logically analogous to the
		  3D unsplit CTU method by Saltzman [J. Saltzman, An unsplit
		  3D upwind method for hyperbolic conservation laws, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 115 (1994) 153-168]. The major novelties in
		  our algorithms are twofold. First, we extend the reduced
		  CTU scheme to the full CTU scheme which is able to run with
		  CFL numbers close to unity. Both methods utilize the
		  transverse update technique developed in the 2D USM
		  algorithm to account for transverse fluxes without solving
		  intermediate Riemann problems, which in turn gives
		  cost-effective 3D methods by reducing the total number of
		  Riemann solves. The proposed algorithms are simple and
		  efficient especially when including multidimensional MHD
		  terms that maintain in-plane magnetic field dynamics.
		  Second, we introduce a new CT scheme that makes use of
		  proper upwind information in taking averages of electric
		  fields. Our 3D USM schemes can be easily combined with
		  various reconstruction methods (e.g., first-order Godunov,
		  second-order MUSCL-Hancock, third-order PPM and fifth-order
		  WENO), and a wide choice of 1D based Riemann solvers (e.g.,
		  local Lax-Friedrichs, HLLE, HLLC, HLLD, and Roe). The 3D
		  USM-MHD solver is available in the University of Chicago
		  Flash Center's official FLASH release.},

  Abstract	= {FLASH is a publicly available high performance application
		  code which has evolved into a modular, extensible software
		  system from a collection of unconnected legacy codes. FLASH
		  has been successful because its capabilities have been
		  driven by the needs of scientific applications, without
		  compromising maintainability, performance, and usability.
		  In its newest incarnation, FLASH3 consists of
		  inter-operable modules that can be combined to generate
		  different applications. The FLASH architecture allows
		  arbitrarily many alternative implementations of its
		  components to co-exist and interchange with each other,
		  resulting in greater flexibility. Further, a simple and
		  elegant mechanism exists for customization of code
		  functionality without the need to modify the core
		  implementation of the source. A built-in unit test
		  framework providing verifiability, combined with a rigorous
		  software maintenance process, allow the code to operate
		  simultaneously in the dual mode of production and
		  development. In this paper we describe the FLASH3
		  architecture, with emphasis on solutions to the more
		  challenging conflicts arising from solver complexity,
		  portable performance requirements, and legacy codes. We
		  also include results from user surveys conducted in 2005
		  and 2007, which highlight the success of the code.},

  Abstract	= {In the implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) paradigm, the
		  dissipative nature of high-resolution shock-capturing
		  schemes is exploited to provide an implicit model of
		  turbulence. The ILES approach has been applied to different
		  contexts, with varying degrees of success. It is the
		  de-facto standard in many astrophysical simulations and in
		  particular in studies of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN).
		  Recent 3D simulations suggest that turbulence might play a
		  crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions, however
		  the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these
		  studies is unclear. Especially considering that the
		  accuracy of ILES for the regime of interest in CCSN, weakly
		  compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been
		  systematically assessed before. Anisotropy, in particular,
		  could impact the dissipative properties of the flow and
		  enhance the turbulent pressure in the radial direction,
		  favouring the explosion. In this paper we assess the
		  accuracy of ILES using numerical methods most commonly
		  employed in computational astrophysics by means of a number
		  of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,
		  anisotropic turbulence. Our simulations employ several
		  different methods and span a wide range of resolutions. We
		  report a detailed analysis of the way in which the
		  turbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our
		  results suggest that anisotropy and compressibility in CCSN
		  turbulence have little effect on the turbulent kinetic
		  energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov scaling is obtained in the
		  inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic
		  energy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly
		  captured even at low resolutions, suggesting that very high
		  "effective Reynolds number" can be achieved at the largest
		  scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the dynamics
		  at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated
		  by the so-called bottleneck effect, i.e., the pile up of
		  kinetic energy close to the dissipation range due to the
		  partial suppression of the energy cascade by numerical
		  viscosity. An inertial range is not recovered until the
		  point where high resolution ˜5123, which would be
		  difficult to realize in global simulations, is reached. We
		  discuss the consequences for CCSN simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We conduct a series of numerical experiments into the
		  nature of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics in the
		  postbounce stalled-shock phase of core-collapse supernovae
		  using 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a
		  27 M&sun; progenitor star with a neutrino leakage/heating
		  scheme. We vary the strength of neutrino heating and find
		  three cases of 3D dynamics: (1) neutrino-driven convection,
		  (2) initially neutrino-driven convection and subsequent
		  development of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI), and (3) SASI-dominated evolution. This confirms
		  previous 3D results of Hanke et al. and Couch & Connor. We
		  carry out simulations with resolutions differing by up to a
		  factor of ˜4 and demonstrate that low resolution is
		  artificially favorable for explosion in the 3D
		  convection-dominated case since it decreases the efficiency
		  of energy transport to small scales. Low resolution results
		  in higher radial convective fluxes of energy and enthalpy,
		  more fully buoyant mass, and stronger neutrino heating. In
		  the SASI-dominated case, lower resolution damps SASI
		  oscillations. In the convection-dominated case, a
		  quasi-stationary angular kinetic energy spectrum E(l)
		  develops in the heating layer. Like other 3D studies, we
		  find E(l) ∝l-1 in the ``inertial range,'' while theory
		  and local simulations argue for E(l) ∝ l-5/3. We argue
		  that current 3D simulations do not resolve the inertial
		  range of turbulence and are affected by numerical viscosity
		  up to the energy-containing scale, creating a
		  ``bottleneck'' that prevents an efficient turbulent
		  cascade.},

  Abstract	= {Supernovae of Type II occur at the end of the evolution of

		  core under gravity is well understood and takes a fraction
		  of a second. To understand the phenomenon, a detailed
		  knowledge of the equation of state at the relevant
		  densities and temperatures is required. After collapse, the
		  shock wave moves outward, but probably does not succeed in
		  expelling the mass of the star. The most likely mechanism
		  to do so is the absorption of neutrinos from the core by
		  the material at medium distances. Observations and theory
		  connected with SN 1987A are discussed, as are the

  Abstract	= {We report on the stellar core collapse, bounce, and
		  postbounce evolution of a 13 Msolar star in a
		  self-consistent general relativistic spherically symmetric
		  simulation based on Boltzmann neutrino transport. We
		  conclude that approximations to exact neutrino transport
		  and the omission of general relativistic effects were not
		  alone responsible for the failure of numerous preceding
		  attempts to model supernova explosions in spherical
		  symmetry. Compared to simulations in Newtonian gravity, the
		  general relativistic simulation results in a smaller shock
		  radius. We however argue that the higher neutrino
		  luminosities and rms energies in the general relativistic
		  case could lead to a larger supernova explosion energy.},

  Abstract	= {By performing neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations
		  in spherical symmetry (1D) and axial symmetry (2D) with
		  different progenitor models by Woosley & Heger (2007) from
		  12 $M_\odot$ to 100 $M_\odot$, we find that all 1D runs
		  fail to produce explosion and several 2D runs succeed. The
		  difference of shock evolution can be interpreted by the
		  difference of mass accretion history, which is determined
		  by the density structure of the progenitor. The exploding
		  models exhibit high neutrino luminosity with low mass
		  accretion rate. This is consistent with the discussion
		  about the so-called critical curve in the mass accretion
		  rate and neutrino luminosity plane, above which there is no
		  steady solution of the accretion flow so that a dynamical
		  expanding shock wave is expected. In addition, we developed
		  a phenomenological model to evaluate the trajectories in
		  this plane. This model reasonably reproduces the numerical
		  results by using the initial density structure of the
		  progenitors alone. By this model, we can predict the
		  possibility of explosion by using the initial density
		  structure of the progenitors alone.},

  Abstract	= {We present an open-source update to the spherically
		  symmetric, general-relativistic hydrodynamics,
		  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) code GR1D. The source code
		  is available at http://www.GR1Dcode.org. We extend its
		  capabilities to include a general-relativistic treatment of
		  neutrino transport based on the moment formalisms of
		  Shibata et al. and Cardall et al. We pay special attention
		  to implementing and testing numerical methods and
		  approximations that lessen the computational demand of the
		  transport scheme by removing the need to invert large
		  matrices. This is especially important for the
		  implementation and development of moment-like transport
		  methods in two and three dimensions. A critical component
		  of neutrino transport calculations is the neutrino-matter
		  interaction coefficients that describe the production,
		  absorption, scattering, and annihilation of neutrinos. In
		  this article we also describe our open-source neutrino
		  interaction library NuLib (available at
		  http://www.nulib.org). We believe that an open-source
		  approach to describing these interactions is one of the
		  major steps needed to progress toward robust models of
		  CCSNe and robust predictions of the neutrino signal. We
		  show, via comparisons to full Boltzmann neutrino-transport
		  simulations of CCSNe, that our neutrino transport code
		  performs remarkably well. Furthermore, we show that the
		  methods and approximations we employ to increase efficiency
		  do not decrease the fidelity of our results. We also test
		  the ability of our general-relativistic transport code to
		  model failed CCSNe by evolving a 40-solar-mass progenitor
		  to the onset of collapse to a black hole.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first successful simulation of a
		  neutrino-driven supernova explosion in three dimensions
		  (3D), using the Prometheus-Vertex code with an axis-free
		  Yin-Yang grid and a sophisticated treatment of
		  three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport. The
		  progenitor is a nonrotating, zero-metallicity 9.6 {{M}&sun;
		  } star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry
		  outward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after
		  bounce, a successful explosion starts at ˜130 ms
		  postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model explodes at
		  about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in
		  2D and a more quickly increasing and roughly 10% higher
		  explosion energy of >1050 erg. The more favorable explosion
		  conditions in 3D are explained by lower temperatures and
		  thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer below
		  the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and
		  leads to a bigger mass in the gain layer, whose larger
		  recombination energy boosts the explosion energy in 3D.
		  These differences are caused by less coherent, less
		  massive, and less rapid convective downdrafts associated
		  with postshock convection in 3D. The less violent impact of
		  these accretion downflows in the cooling layer produces
		  less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses
		  by neutrino emission. We thus have, for the first time,
		  identified a reduced mass accretion rate, lower infall
		  velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of
		  convective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock
		  turbulence that facilitate neutrino-driven explosions and
		  strengthen them compared to the 2D case.},

		  Both 3D and 2D models achieve explosions; however, the

		  of the supernovae that happen in massive stars, but, to
		  this day, a first principles model of how the explosion is
		  energized is lacking. Nevertheless, a quantitative theory
		  of nucleosynthesis is possible. We present a survey of the
		  nucleosynthesis that occurs in 32 stars of solar
		  metallicity in the mass range 12 120M. The most recent set
		  of solar abundances, opacities, mass loss rates, and
		  current estimates of nuclear reaction rates are employed.
		  Restrictions on the mass cut and explosion energy of the
		  supernovae based upon nucleosynthesis, measured neutron
		  star masses, and light curves are discussed and applied.
		  The nucleosynthetic results, when integrated over a
		  Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), agree quite well with
		  what is seen in the sun. We discuss in some detail the
		  production of the long lived radioactivities, 26Al and
		  60Fe, and why recent model-based estimates of the ratio
		  60Fe/Al are overly large compared with what satellites have

  Abstract	= {We report on a method, PUSH, for artificially triggering
		  core-collapse supernova explosions of massive stars in
		  spherical symmetry. We explore basic explosion properties
		  and calibrate PUSH to reproduce SN 1987A observables. Our
		  simulations are based on the GR hydrodynamics code AGILE
		  combined with the neutrino transport scheme isotropic
		  diffusion source approximation for electron neutrinos and
		  advanced spectral leakage for the heavy flavor neutrinos.
		  To trigger explosions in the otherwise non-exploding
		  simulations, the PUSH method increases the energy
		  deposition in the gain region proportionally to the heavy
		  flavor neutrino fluxes. We explore the progenitor range
		  18--21 {{M}}o . Our studies reveal a distinction between
		  high compactness (HC; compactness parameter {xi }1.75\gt
		  0.45) and low compactness (LC; {xi }1.75\lt 0.45)
		  progenitor models, where LC models tend to explode earlier,
		  with a lower explosion energy, and with a lower remnant
		  mass. HC models are needed to obtain explosion energies
		  around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN 1987A. However, all the
		  models with sufficiently high explosion energy overproduce
		  56Ni and fallback is needed to reproduce the observed
		  nucleosynthesis yields. 57--58Ni yields depend sensitively
		  on the electron fraction and on the location of the mass
		  cut with respect to the shell structure of the progenitor.
		  We identify a progenitor and a suitable set of parameters
		  that fit the explosion properties of SN 1987A assuming 0.1
		  {{M}}o of fallback. We predict a neutron star with a
		  gravitational mass of 1.50 {{M}}o . We find correlations
		  between explosion properties and the compactness of the
		  progenitor model in the explored mass range. However, a
		  more complete analysis will require exploring of a larger
		  set of progenitors.},

  Abstract	= {Interactions with neutrons and protons play a crucial role
		  for the neutrino opacity of matter in the supernova core.
		  Their current implementation in many simulation codes,
		  however, is rather schematic and ignores not only
		  modifications for the correlated nuclear medium of the
		  nascent neutron star, but also free-space corrections from
		  nucleon recoil, weak magnetism, or strange quarks, which
		  can easily add up to changes of several 10% for neutrino
		  energies in the spectral peak. In the Garching supernova
		  simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, such
		  sophistications have been included for a long time except
		  for the strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin,
		  which affect neutral-current neutrino scattering. We
		  demonstrate on the basis of a 20 {M}o progenitor star that
		  a moderate strangeness-dependent contribution of
		  {g}{{a}}{{s}}=-0.2 to the axial-vector coupling constant
		  {g}{{a}}≈ 1.26 can turn an unsuccessful three-dimensional
		  (3D) model into a successful explosion. Such a modification
		  is in the direction of current experimental results and
		  reduces the neutral-current scattering opacity of neutrons,
		  which dominate in the medium around and above the
		  neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities and
		  mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the
		  neutrino-energy deposition in the heating layer. Higher
		  nonradial kinetic energy in the gain layer signals enhanced
		  buoyancy activity that enables the onset of the explosion
		  at ~300 ms after bounce, in contrast to the model with
		  vanishing strangeness contributions to neutrino--nucleon
		  scattering. Our results demonstrate the close proximity to
		  explosion of the previously published, unsuccessful 3D
		  models of the Garching group.},

  Abstract	= {We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations for 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$
		  progenitors. All of the simulations yield explosions and
		  have been evolved for at least 1.2 seconds after core
		  bounce and 1 second after material first becomes unbound.
		  Simulations were computed with our Chimera code employing
		  spectral neutrino transport, special and general
		  relativistic transport effects, and state-of-the-art
		  neutrino interactions. Continuing the evolution beyond 1
		  second allows explosions to develop more fully and the
		  processes powering the explosions to become more clearly
		  evident. We compute explosion energy estimates, including
		  the binding energy of the stellar envelope outside the
		  shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38, and 0.70 B ($10^{51}$ ergs) and
		  increasing at 0.03, 0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 B s$^{-1}$,
		  respectively, for the 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\odot$ models.
		  Three models developed pronounced prolate shock
		  morphologies, while the 20 $M_\odot$ model, though
		  exhibiting lobes and accretion streams like the other
		  models, develops an approximately spherical, off-center
		  shock as the explosion begins and then becomes moderately
		  prolate $\sim$600 ms after bounce. This reduces the
		  explosion energy relative to the other models by reducing
		  mass accretion during the critical explosion power-up
		  phase. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in our
		  models through detailed analyses of the energy sources and
		  flows. We find that the 12 and 20 $M_\odot$ models have
		  explosion energies comparable to that of the lower range of
		  observed explosion energies while the 15 and 25 $M_\odot$
		  models are within the range of observed explosion energies,
		  particularly considering the rate at which their explosion
		  energies are increasing. The ejected $^{56}$Ni masses given
		  by our models are all within observational limits as are

  Abstract	= {We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulation of
		  the final minutes of iron core growth in a massive star, up
		  to and including the point of core gravitational
		  instability and collapse. We capture the development of
		  strong convection driven by violent Si burning in the shell
		  surrounding the iron core. This convective burning builds
		  the iron core to its critical mass and collapse ensues,
		  driven by electron capture and photodisintegration. The
		  non-spherical structure and motion generated by 3D
		  convection is substantial at the point of collapse, with
		  convective speeds of several hundreds of km s-1. We examine
		  the impact of such physically realistic 3D initial
		  conditions on the core-collapse supernova mechanism using
		  3D simulations including multispecies neutrino leakage and
		  find that the enhanced post-shock turbulence resulting from
		  3D progenitor structure aids successful explosions. We
		  conclude that non-spherical progenitor structure should not
		  be ignored, and should have a significant and favorable
		  impact on the likelihood for neutrino-driven explosions. In
		  order to make simulating the 3D collapse of an iron core
		  feasible, we were forced to make approximations to the

  Abstract	= {The mechanism for revival of a stalled supernova shock

		  Neutrinos from the hot, inner core of the supernova are
		  absorbed in the outer layers, and although only about 0.1
		  percent of their energy is so absorbed, this is enough to
		  eject the outer part of the star and leave only enough mass
		  to form a neutron star. The neutrino absorption is
		  independent of the density of material. After the shock
		  recedes to some extent, neutrino heating establishes a
		  sufficient pressure gradient to push the material beyond
		  about 150 km outward, while the material further in falls
		  rapidly toward the core. This makes the density near 150 km
		  decrease spectacularly, creating a quasi-vacuum in which
		  the pressure is mainly carried by radiation. This is a
		  perfect condition to make the internal energy of the matter
		  sufficient to escape from the gravitational attraction of
		  the star. The net energy of the outgoing shock is about 4 x
		  10 to the 50th ergs.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first two-dimensional general relativistic
		  (GR) simulations of stellar core collapse and explosion
		  with the COCONUT hydrodynamics code in combination with the
		  VERTEX solver for energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino
		  transport, using the extended conformal flatness condition
		  for approximating the space-time metric and a
		  ray-by-ray-plus ansatz to tackle the multi-dimensionality
		  of the transport. For both of the investigated 11.2 and 15
		  M &sun; progenitors we obtain successful, though seemingly
		  marginal, neutrino-driven supernova explosions. This
		  outcome and the time evolution of the models basically
		  agree with results previously obtained with the PROMETHEUS
		  hydro solver including an approximative treatment of
		  relativistic effects by a modified Newtonian potential.
		  However, GR models exhibit subtle differences in the
		  neutrinospheric conditions compared with Newtonian and
		  pseudo-Newtonian simulations. These differences lead to
		  significantly higher luminosities and mean energies of the
		  radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and therefore
		  to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies
		  in the gain layer with favorable consequences for strong
		  nonradial mass motions and ultimately for an explosion.
		  Moreover, energy transfer to the stellar medium around the
		  neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering
		  reactions of heavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the
		  mentioned effects. Together with previous pseudo-Newtonian
		  models, the presented relativistic calculations suggest
		  that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging
		  neutrino interactions can make differences of even 50%-100%
		  in some quantities and is likely to contribute to a finally

  Abstract	= {A major goal over the last decade has been understanding
		  which multidimensional effects are crucial in facilitating
		  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Unfortunately,
		  much of this work has necessarily assumed axisymmetry. In
		  this work, we present analyses of simplified
		  two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CCSN models
		  with the goal of comparing the hydrodynamics in setups that
		  differ only in dimension. Not surprisingly, we find many
		  differences between 2D and 3D models. While some
		  differences are subtle and perhaps not crucial, others are
		  dramatic and make interpreting 2D models problematic. In
		  particular, axisymmetric models produce excess power at the
		  largest spatial scales, power that has been deemed critical
		  in previous explosion models. Nevertheless, our 3D models,
		  which have an order of magnitude less power than 2D models
		  on large scales, explode earlier. Since explosions occur
		  earlier in 3D than in 2D, the vigorous large-scale sloshing
		  is either not critical in any dimension or the explosion
		  mechanism operates differently in 2D and 3D. On the other
		  hand, we find that the average parcel of matter in the gain
		  region has been exposed to net heating for up to 30% longer
		  in 3D than in 2D, an effect we attribute to the differing
		  characters of turbulence in 2D and 3D. We suggest that this
		  effect plays a prominent role in producing earlier
		  explosions in 3D. Finally, we discuss a simple model for
		  the runaway growth of buoyant bubbles that is able to
		  quantitatively account for the growth of the shock radius
		  and predicts a critical luminosity relation.},

  Abstract	= {Neutrino transport and neutrino interactions in dense
		  matter play a crucial role in stellar core collapse,
		  supernova explosions and neutron star formation. Here we
		  present a detailed description of a new numerical code for
		  treating the time and energy dependent neutrino transport
		  in hydrodynamical simulations of such events. The code is
		  based on a variable Eddington factor method to deal with
		  the integro-differential character of the Boltzmann
		  equation. The moments of the neutrino distribution function
		  and the energy and lepton number exchange with the stellar
		  medium are determined by iteratively solving the zeroth and
		  first order moment equations in combination with a model
		  Boltzmann equation. The latter is discretized on a grid of
		  tangent rays. The integration of the transport equations
		  and the neutrino source terms is performed in a
		  time-implicit way. In the present version of the program,
		  the transport part is coupled to an explicit hydrodynamics
		  code which follows the evolution of the stellar plasma by a
		  finite-volume method with piecewise parabolic
		  interpolation, using a Riemann solver to calculate the
		  hydrodynamic states. The neutrino source terms are
		  implemented in an operator-split step. Neutrino transport
		  and hydrodynamics can be calculated with different spatial
		  grids and different time steps. The structure of the
		  described code is modular and offers a high degree of
		  flexibility for an application to relativistic and
		  multi-dimensional problems at different levels of
		  refinement and accuracy. We critically evaluate results for
		  a number of test cases, including neutrino transport in
		  rapidly moving stellar media and approximate relativistic
		  core collapse, and suggest a path for generalizing the code
		  to be used in multi-dimensional simulations of convection
		  in neutron stars and supernovae. Appendices A and B and all
		  their figures are only available at

  Abstract	= {Three-dimensional (3D) simulations of core-collapse
		  supernovae (CCSNe) are granting new insight into the
		  as-yet-uncertain mechanism that drives successful
		  explosions. While there is still debate about whether
		  explosions are obtained more easily in 3D than in 2D, it is
		  undeniable that there exist qualitative and quantitative
		  differences between the results of 3D and 2D simulations.
		  We present an extensive set of high-resolution 1D, 2D, and
		  3D CCSN simulations with multispecies neutrino leakage
		  carried out in two different progenitors. Our simulations
		  confirm the results of Couch indicating that 2D explodes
		  more readily than 3D. We argue that this is due to the
		  inadequacies of 2D to accurately capture important aspects
		  of the 3D dynamics. We find that without artificially
		  enhancing the neutrino heating rate, we do not obtain
		  explosions in 3D. We examine the development of
		  neutrino-driven convection and the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) and find that, in separate regimes,
		  either instability can dominate. We find evidence for
		  growth of the SASI for both 15 M &sun; and 27 M &sun;
		  progenitors; however, it is weaker in 3D exploding models.
		  The growth rate of both instabilities is artificially
		  enhanced along the symmetry axis in 2D as compared with our
		  axis-free 3D Cartesian simulations. Our work highlights the
		  growing consensus that CCSNe must be studied in 3D if we
		  hope to solve the mystery of how the explosions are

  Abstract	= {We investigate the structure of the stalled supernova
		  shock in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D,
		  respectively) and explore the differences in the effects of
		  neutrino heating and the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI). We find that early on the amplitude of
		  the dipolar mode of the shock is factors of ~2-3 smaller in
		  3D than in 2D. However, later in both 3D and 2D, the
		  monopole and dipole modes start to grow until explosion.
		  Whereas in 2D, the (l, m) = (1, 0) mode changes sign
		  quasi-periodically, producing the "up-and-down" motion
		  always seen in modern 2D simulations, in 3D this almost
		  never happens. Rather, in 3D when the dipolar mode starts
		  to grow, it grows in magnitude and wanders stochastically
		  in direction until settling before explosion to a
		  particular patch of solid angle. Furthermore, in 2D, we
		  find that the amplitude of the dipolar shock deformation
		  separates into two classes. For the first, identified with
		  the SASI and for a wide range of "low" neutrino
		  luminosities, this amplitude remains small and roughly
		  constant. For the other, identified with higher
		  luminosities and neutrino-driven convection, the dipolar
		  amplitude grows sharply. Importantly, it is only for this
		  higher luminosity class that we see neutrino-driven
		  explosions within ~1 s of bounce. Moreover, for the "low"
		  luminosity runs (including zero), the power spectra of
		  these dipolar oscillations peak in the 30-50 Hz range
		  associated with advection timescales, while for the
		  high-luminosity runs the power spectra at lower frequencies
		  are significantly more prominent. We associate this
		  enhanced power at lower frequencies with slower convective
		  effects and the secular growth of the dipolar shock
		  amplitude. Though our study involves a simplified,
		  parameterized approach, on the basis of it we hypothesize
		  that neutrino-driven buoyant convection should almost
		  always dominate the SASI when the supernova explosion is
		  neutrino-driven.},

  Abstract	= {Following a simulation approach of recent publications, we
		  explore the viability of the neutrino-heating explosion
		  mechanism's dependence on the spatial dimension. Our
		  results disagree with previous findings. While we also
		  observe that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower
		  driving neutrino luminosity than spherically symmetric (1D)
		  models, we do not find that explosions in 3D occur easier
		  and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that the average
		  entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the
		  dimension and thus is not a good diagnostic quantity for
		  the readiness to explode. Instead, mass, integrated
		  entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and non-radial
		  kinetic energy in the gain layer are higher when models are
		  closer to explosion. Coherent, large-scale mass motions as
		  typically associated with the standing accretion-shock
		  instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for
		  explosions because they drive strong shock expansion and
		  thus enlarge the gain layer. While 2D models with better
		  angular resolution clearly explode more easily, the
		  opposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a
		  consequence of the turbulent energy cascade, which
		  transports energy from small to large spatial scales in 2D,
		  thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow
		  in 3D is in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation
		  and vortex motions on smaller scales and thus making the 3D
		  evolution with finer grid resolution more similar to 1D.
		  More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may
		  therefore be tightly linked to efficient growth of
		  low-order SASI modes including nonaxisymmetric ones.},

		  of dimension, with three dimensions (3D) requiring ~40%-50%
		  lower driving neutrino luminosity than one dimension and
		  ~15%-25% lower driving neutrino luminosity than two

		  (PNS) convection, which is stronger in the hemisphere of

  Abstract	= {We present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of
		  stellar core collapse and develop the framework for a
		  detailed analysis of the energetic aspects of
		  neutrino-powered supernova explosions. Our results confirm
		  that the neutrino-heating mechanism remains a viable
		  explanation of the explosion of a wider mass range of
		  supernova progenitors with iron cores, but the explosion
		  sets in later and develops differently than thought so far.
		  The calculations were performed with an energy-dependent
		  treatment of the neutrino transport based on the
		  "ray-by-ray plus" approximation, in which the neutrino
		  number, energy, and momentum equations are closed with a
		  variable Eddington factor obtained by iteratively solving a
		  model Boltzmann equation. We focus here on the evolution of
		  a 15 M sun progenitor and provide evidence that shock
		  revival and an explosion are initiated at about 600 ms
		  after core bounce, powered by neutrino energy deposition.
		  This is significantly later than previously found for an
		  11.2 M sun star, for which we also present a continuation
		  of the explosion model published by Buras et al. The onset
		  of the blast is fostered in both cases by the standing
		  accretion-shock instability. This instability exhibits
		  highest growth rates for the dipole and quadrupole modes,
		  which lead to large-amplitude bipolar shock oscillations
		  and push the shock to larger radii, thus increasing the
		  time accreted matter is exposed to neutrino heating in the
		  gain layer. As a consequence, also convective overturn
		  behind the shock is strengthened, which otherwise is
		  suppressed or damped because of the small shock stagnation
		  radius. When the explosion sets in, the shock reveals a
		  pronounced global deformation with a dominant dipolar
		  component. In both the 11.2 M sun and 15 M sun explosions
		  long-lasting equatorial downflows supply the gain layer
		  with fresh gas, of which a sizable fraction is heated by
		  neutrinos and leads to the build-up of the explosion energy
		  of the ejecta over possibly hundreds of milliseconds. A
		  "soft" nuclear equation of state that causes a rapid
		  contraction, and a smaller radius of the forming neutron
		  star and thus a fast release of gravitational binding
		  energy, seems to be more favorable for the development of
		  an explosion. Rotation has the opposite effect because in
		  the long run it leads to a more extended and cooler neutron
		  star and thus lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies
		  and overall less neutrino heating. Neutron star g-mode
		  oscillations, although we see their presence, and the
		  acoustic mechanism play no important role in our
		  simulations. While numerical tests show that our code is
		  also well able to follow large-amplitude core g-modes if
		  they are instigated; the amplitude of such oscillations
		  remains small in our supernova runs and the acoustic energy
		  flux injected by the ringing neutron star and by the
		  deceleration of supersonic downflows near the neutron star
		  surface is small compared to the neutrino energy
		  deposition.},

  Abstract	= {Multi-dimensional instabilities have become an important
		  ingredient in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) theory.
		  Therefore, it is necessary to understand the driving
		  mechanism of the dominant instability. We compare our
		  parameterized three-dimensional CCSN simulations with other
		  buoyancy-driven simulations and propose scaling relations
		  for neutrino-driven convection. Through these comparisons,
		  we infer that buoyancy-driven convection dominates
		  post-shock turbulence in our simulations. In support of
		  this inference, we present four major results. First, the
		  convective fluxes and kinetic energies in the
		  neutrino-heated region are consistent with expectations of
		  buoyancy-driven convection. Second, the convective flux is
		  positive where buoyancy actively drives convection, and the
		  radial and tangential components of the kinetic energy are
		  in rough equipartition (i.e., Kr ~ K theta + K phi). Both
		  results are natural consequences of buoyancy-driven
		  convection, and are commonly observed in simulations of
		  convection. Third, buoyant driving is balanced by turbulent
		  dissipation. Fourth, the convective luminosity and

  Abstract	= {The relevance of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI) compared to neutrino-driven convection in
		  three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core environments is still
		  highly controversial. Studying a 27 M &sun; progenitor, we
		  demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity
		  can develop in 3D simulations with detailed neutrino
		  transport despite the presence of convection. This result
		  was obtained with the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code with the same
		  sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in
		  one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) models. While
		  buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass
		  motions in the postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with
		  growing amplitude sets in during a phase of shock
		  retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose
		  growth is only quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO
		  interface leads to strong shock expansion in response to a
		  dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the phase
		  of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the
		  postshock layer exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by
		  the lowest-order spherical harmonics (l = 1, m = 0, $\pm$1)
		  in distinct contrast to the higher multipole structures
		  associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that
		  the SASI amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic
		  energy in three dimensions can exceed those of the
		  corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the
		  evolution. We also perform parameterized 3D simulations of
		  a 25 M &sun; progenitor, using a simplified, gray neutrino
		  transport scheme, an axis-free Yin-Yang grid, and different
		  amplitudes of random seed perturbations. They confirm the
		  importance of the SASI for another progenitor, its
		  independence of the choice of spherical grid, and its
		  preferred growth for fast accretion flows connected to
		  small shock radii and compact proto-neutron stars as
		  previously found in 2D setups.},

  Abstract	= {Self-gravity computation by multipole expansion is a
		  common approach in problems such as core-collapse and Type
		  Ia supernovae, where single large condensations of mass
		  must be treated. The standard formulation of multipole
		  self-gravity in arbitrary coordinate systems suffers from
		  two significant sources of error, which we correct in the
		  formulation presented in this article. The first source of
		  error is due to the numerical approximation that
		  effectively places grid cell mass at the central point of
		  the cell, then computes the gravitational potential at that
		  point, resulting in a convergence failure of the multipole
		  expansion. We describe a new scheme that avoids this
		  problem by computing gravitational potential at cell faces.
		  The second source of error is due to sub-optimal choice of
		  location for the expansion center, which results in angular
		  power at high multipole l values in the gravitational
		  field, requiring a high---and expensive---value of
		  multipole cutoff l max. By introducing a global measure of
		  angular power in the gravitational field, we show that the
		  optimal coordinate for the expansion is the
		  square-density-weighted mean location. We subject our new
		  multipole self-gravity algorithm, implemented in the FLASH
		  simulation framework, to two rigorous test problems:
		  MacLaurin spheroids for which exact analytic solutions are
		  known, and core-collapse supernovae. We show that key
		  observables of the core-collapse simulations, particularly
		  shock expansion, proto-neutron star motion, and momentum
		  conservation, are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of
		  the multipole gravity, and the accuracy of their
		  computation is greatly improved by our reformulated
		  solver.},

  Abstract	= {We investigate the effects of neutrino heating and

		  core-collapse supernovae. Our focus is on the nonlinear
		  dynamics of the shock wave that forms in the collapse and
		  the assembly of positive energy material below it. To this
		  end, we perform time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations
		  with FLASH2.5 in spherical and axial symmetry. These
		  generalize our previous calculations by allowing for bulk
		  neutrino heating and for nuclear statistical equilibrium
		  between n, p, and alpha. The heating rate is freely
		  tunable, as is the starting radius of the shock relative to
		  the recombination radius of alpha-particles. An explosion
		  in spherical symmetry involves the excitation of an
		  overstable mode, which may be viewed as the ell = 0 version
		  of the "Standing Accretion Shock Instability." In
		  two-dimensional simulations, nonspherical deformations of
		  the shock are driven by plumes of material with positive
		  Bernoulli parameter, which are concentrated well outside
		  the zone of strong neutrino heating. The nonspherical modes
		  of the shock reach a large amplitude only when the heating
		  rate is also high enough to excite convection below the
		  shock. The critical heating rate that causes an explosion
		  depends sensitively on the initial position of the shock
		  relative to the recombination radius. Weaker heating is
		  required to drive an explosion in two dimensions than in
		  one, but the difference also depends on the size of the
		  shock. Forcing the infalling heavy nuclei to break up into
		  n and p below the shock only causes a slight increase in
		  the critical heating rate, except when the shock starts out
		  at a large radius. This shows that heating by neutrinos (or
		  some other mechanism) must play a significant role in
		  pushing the shock far enough out that recombination heating

  Abstract	= {We present a spherically symmetric, Newtonian core
		  collapse simulation of a 15 Msolar star with a 1.28 Msolar
		  iron core. The time-, energy-, and angle-dependent
		  transport of electron neutrinos (nue) and antineutrinos
		  (nue) was treated with a new code that iteratively solves
		  the Boltzmann equation and the equations for neutrino
		  number, energy, and momentum to order O(v/c) in the
		  velocity v of the stellar medium. The supernova shock
		  expands to a maximum radius of 350 km instead of only ~240
		  km as in a comparable calculation with multigroup
		  flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) by Bruenn, Mezzacappa, &
		  Dineva. This may be explained by stronger neutrino heating
		  due to the more accurate transport in our model.
		  Nevertheless, after 180 ms of expansion the shock finally
		  recedes to a radius around 250 km (compared to ~170 km in
		  the MGFLD run). The effect of an accurate neutrino

  Abstract	= {We present one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and
		  three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of
		  core-collapse supernovae including a parameterized neutrino
		  heating and cooling scheme in order to investigate the
		  critical core neutrino luminosity (L crit) required for
		  explosion. In contrast to some previous works, we find that
		  3D simulations explode later than 2D simulations, and that
		  L crit at fixed mass accretion rate is somewhat higher in
		  three dimensions than in two dimensions. We find, however,
		  that in two dimensions L crit increases as the numerical
		  resolution of the simulation increases. In contrast to some
		  previous works, we argue that the average entropy of the
		  gain region is in fact not a good indicator of explosion
		  but is rather a reflection of the greater mass in the gain
		  region in two dimensions. We compare our simulations to
		  semi-analytic explosion criteria and examine the nature of
		  the convective motions in two dimensions and three
		  dimensions. We discuss the balance between neutrino-driven
		  buoyancy and drag forces. In particular, we show that the
		  drag force will be proportional to a buoyant plume's
		  surface area while the buoyant force is proportional to a
		  plume's volume and, therefore, plumes with greater
		  volume-to-surface-area ratios will rise more quickly. We
		  show that buoyant plumes in two dimensions are inherently
		  larger, with greater volume-to-surface-area ratios, than
		  plumes in three dimensions. In the scenario that the
		  supernova shock expansion is dominated by neutrino-driven
		  buoyancy, this balance between buoyancy and drag forces may
		  explain why 3D simulations explode later than 2D
		  simulations and why L crit increases with resolution.
		  Finally, we provide a comparison of our results with other
		  calculations in the literature.},

  Abstract	= {We describe the results of 3D numerical simulations of
		  oxygen shell burning and hydrogen core burning in a 23
		  Msolar stellar model. A detailed comparison is made to
		  stellar mixing-length theory (MLT) for the shell-burning
		  model. Simulations in 2D are significantly different from
		  3D, in terms of both flow morphology and velocity
		  amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted
		  using a dynamic boundary condition based on the bulk
		  Richardson number than by purely local, static criteria
		  like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description
		  of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for shell
		  convection; however, there are other important effects that
		  it does not capture, mostly related to the dynamical motion
		  of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective
		  regions. There is asymmetry between upflows and downflows,
		  so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero. The motion of
		  convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves; this is
		  a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective
		  plumes. Convective ``overshooting'' is best described as an
		  elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than
		  ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent
		  eddies. The convective boundaries are rife with internal

		  RiB=DeltabL/sigma2H for the conditions studied,
		  20<~RiB<~420. We find E=ARi-nB, with best-fit values

		  200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the

		  convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to
		  give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
		  (typically 1.2 × 1051 ergs), and the explosive

		  likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience
		  considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the
		  initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions
		  will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light
		  curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have
		  dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
		  black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The

		  strong dynamical interactions between shells are seen in
		  2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior
		  proceeds to sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples
		  to the nuclear burning. Dramatic growth of low-order modes
		  is seen as well as large deviations from spherical symmetry

  Abstract	= {We present here the first 2D rotating, multigroup,
		  radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of
		  supernova core collapse, bounce, and explosion. In the
		  context of rapid rotation, we focus on the dynamical
		  effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and
		  propagation of MHD jets. We find that a quasi-steady state
		  can be quickly established after bounce, during which a
		  well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping
		  of power from the differentially rotating core. If the
		  initial spin period of the progenitor core is <~2 s, the
		  free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving
		  proto-neutron star is adequate to power a supernova
		  explosion and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are
		  well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop
		  stresses and maintain a small opening angle. We see
		  evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet
		  stream. Neutrino heating is subdominant in the rapidly
		  rotating models we explore but can contribute 10%-25% to
		  the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that
		  even in the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova
		  explosion might be followed by a secondary, weak MHD jet
		  explosion, which, because of its weakness, may to date have
		  gone unnoticed in supernova debris. Furthermore, we suggest
		  that the generation of a nonrelativistic MHD precursor jet
		  during the early proto-neutron star/supernova phase is
		  implicit in both the collapsar and ``millisecond magnetar''
		  models of GRBs. The multidimensional, multigroup, rapidly
		  rotating RMHD simulations we describe here are a start
		  along the path toward more realistic simulations of the
		  possible role of magnetic fields in some of nature's most
		  dramatic events.},

@Article{	  iwakami:2014,
  Abstract	= {The effect of rotation on the explosion of core-collapse
		  supernovae is investigated systematically in
		  three-dimensional simulations. In order to obtain the
		  critical conditions for explosion as a function of mass
		  accretion rate, neutrino luminosity, and specific angular
		  momentum, rigidly rotating matter was injected from the
		  outer boundary with an angular momentum, which is increased
		  every 500 ms. It is found that there is a critical value of
		  the specific angular momentum, above which the standing
		  shock wave revives, for a given combination of mass
		  accretion rate and neutrino luminosity, i.e., an explosion
		  can occur by rotation even if the neutrino luminosity is
		  lower than the critical value for a given mass accretion
		  rate in non-rotational models. The coupling of rotation and
		  hydrodynamical instabilities plays an important role in
		  characterizing the dynamics of shock revival for the range
		  of specific angular momentum that are supposed to be
		  realistic. Contrary to expectations from past studies, the
		  most rapidly expanding direction of the shock wave is not
		  aligned with the rotation axis. Being perpendicular to the
		  rotation axis on average, it can be oriented in various
		  directions. Its dispersion is small when the spiral mode of
		  the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) governs the
		  dynamics, while it is large when neutrino-driven convection
		  is dominant. As a result of the comparison between
		  two-dimensional and three-dimensional rotational models, it
		  is found that m != 0 modes of neutrino-driven convection or
		  SASI are important for shock revival around the critical

  Abstract	= {Simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) result in
		  successful explosions once the neutrino luminosity exceeds
		  a critical curve, and recent simulations indicate that
		  turbulence further enables explosion by reducing this
		  critical neutrino luminosity. We propose a theoretical
		  framework to derive this result and take the first steps by
		  deriving the governing mean-field equations. Using Reynolds
		  decomposition, we decompose flow variables into background
		  and turbulent flows and derive self-consistent averaged
		  equations for their evolution. As basic requirements for
		  the CCSN problem, these equations naturally incorporate
		  steady-state accretion, neutrino heating and cooling,
		  non-zero entropy gradients, and turbulence terms associated
		  with buoyant driving, redistribution, and dissipation.
		  Furthermore, analysis of two-dimensional (2D) CCSN
		  simulations validate these Reynolds-averaged equations, and
		  we show that the physics of turbulence entirely accounts
		  for the differences between 1D and 2D CCSN simulations. As
		  a prelude to deriving the reduction in the critical
		  luminosity, we identify the turbulent terms that most
		  influence the conditions for explosion. Generically,
		  turbulence equations require closure models, but these
		  closure models depend upon the macroscopic properties of
		  the flow. To derive a closure model that is appropriate for
		  CCSNe, we cull the literature for relevant closure models
		  and compare each with 2D simulations. These models employ
		  local closure approximations and fail to reproduce the
		  global properties of neutrino-driven turbulence. Motivated
		  by the generic failure of these local models, we propose an
		  original model for turbulence which incorporates global
		  properties of the flow. This global model accurately
		  reproduces the turbulence profiles and evolution of 2D CCSN

  Abstract	= {One- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the
		  neutrino-driven supernova explosion of a 15 M&sun; star are
		  performed for the phase between stagnation of the prompt
		  shock and 1 s after core bounce. Variation of the neutrino
		  ( nu ) fluxes from the nu sphere shows that explosion
		  energy and timescale, initial proto--neutron star mass, and
		  explosive nucleosynthesis of Fe group elements depend
		  sensitively on the strength of the nu heating during the
		  first few 100 ms after shock formation. Convective overturn
		  in the nu -heated region behind the shock is a crucial help
		  for the explosion only in a narrow window of nu
		  luminosities. Here powerful explosions can be obtained only
		  in the multidimensional case, primarily because the
		  overturn increases the efficiency of nu energy deposition
		  by allowing cool postshock matter to penetrate inward to
		  the region of strongest heating, while heated gas can
		  quickly rise outward, thus reducing its energy loss due to
		  reemission of neutrinos. This interpretation is supported
		  by the different increase of the explosion energy with time
		  in one- and two-dimensional models. For higher core nu
		  fluxes spherically symmetrical models also yield energetic
		  explosions, while for lower luminosities even with
		  convection, no strong explosions occur. Cool gas in
		  downflows from the shock to the heating zone loses leptons
		  by nu e emission but gains energy by interactions with the
		  core nu fluxes. However, because it does not get very n
		  rich and its entropy increases, it is not accreted into the
		  low-entropy, neutronized surface of the neutron star.
		  Because of the absence of significant accretion while the
		  explosions develop on a timescale of a few 100 ms, the
		  initial proto--neutron star (baryonic) masses are only ~1.2
		  M&sun;. Turbulent activity around the neutron star is
		  transient; at 200--300 ms after shock formation, the
		  turbulent layer decouples from the nu -heated zone and
		  moves outward behind the supernova shock. The shock shows
		  deformation on large scales. Inhomogeneities of temperature
		  T, density rho , and velocity with contrasts of order unity
		  on scales of 30 deg--45 deg in the shell behind the shock
		  could help to explain anisotropies and radial mixing
		  observed in SN 1987A. When the supernova shock reaches the
		  entropy step of the Si-O interface at 5700 km about
		  400--500 ms after bounce, the rho inversion between the
		  dense shell and the low-density, "hot bubble" region around
		  the neutron star begins to steepen into a strong reverse
		  shock that forms a sharp discontinuity in the nu -driven
		  wind from the nascent neutron star. The deceleration of the
		  wind expansion might trigger significant, anisotropic
		  fallback of matter to the neutron star on a timescale of
		  several seconds.},

		  Swesty and the model of Shen et al. We find that for a
		  given neutrino luminosity, "stiffer" EOS, where stiffness
		  is determined by a combination of nuclear matter properties
		  not just incompressibility, K, explode later than "softer"
		  EOS. The EOS of Shen et al., being the stiffest EOS, by
		  virtue of larger incompressibility and symmetry energy
		  slope, L, explodes later than any of the Lattimer & Swesty
		  EOS models. Amongst the Lattimer & Swesty EOS that all
		  share the same value of L, the explosion time increases
		  with increasing nuclear incompressibility, K. We find that
		  this holds in both 1D and 2D, while for all of the models,
		  explosions are obtained more easily in 2D than in 1D. We
		  argue that this EOS dependence is due in part to a greater
		  amount of acoustic flux from denser proto-neutron star
		  atmospheres that result from a softer EOS. We also discuss
		  the relevance of approximate instability criteria to
		  realistic simulations.},

  Abstract	= {Core-collapse supernovae are among the most fascinating
		  phenomena in astrophysics and provide a formidable
		  challenge for theoretical investigation. They mark the
		  spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an
		  explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun
		  produces during its whole life. A better understanding of
		  the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth sites of
		  neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements,
		  and more reliable predictions of the observable signals
		  from stellar death events are tightly linked to the
		  solution of the long-standing puzzle of how collapsing
		  stars achieve explosion. In this article our current
		  knowledge of the processes that contribute to the success
		  of the explosion mechanism is concisely reviewed. After a
		  short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar
		  core-collapse events, the general properties of
		  progenitor-dependent neutrino emission will be briefly
		  described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in
		  axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as
		  well as in simulations with an approximate treatment of
		  relativistic effects, we can find successful
		  neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor
		  stars. The first results of three-dimensional (3D) models
		  have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic simulations
		  demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the
		  pre-collapse core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered
		  supernova explosions even in nonrotating stars. These
		  results are discussed in the context of the present
		  controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring
		  the supernova mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and
		  they are interpreted against the background of the current
		  disagreement on the question of whether the standing
		  accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven
		  convection is the crucial agency that supports the onset of
		  the explosion.},

  Abstract	= {In this paper, we describe a new hydrodynamics code for

		  operators are made compatible using the support-operator
		  method. We present 1D and 2D gravity solvers that are

		  remapping algorithm and present a modified subcell pressure
		  scheme that avoids this problem. Strengths of this code
		  include a straightforward structure, enabling simple

  Abstract	= {We present new two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric neutrino
		  radiation/hydrodynamic models of core-collapse supernova
		  (CCSN) cores. We use the CASTRO code, which incorporates
		  truly multi-dimensional, multi-group, flux-limited
		  diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all
		  relevant {O}(v/c) terms. Our main motivation for carrying
		  out this study is to compare with recent 2D models produced
		  by other groups who have obtained explosions for some
		  progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN results that did
		  not incorporate {O}(v/c) terms. We follow the evolution of
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately
		  600 ms after bounce and do not obtain an explosion in any
		  of these models. Though the reason for the qualitative
		  disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
		  remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying
		  "ray-by-ray" approach employed by all other groups may be
		  compromising their results. We show that "ray-by-ray"
		  calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
		  variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are
		  better captured by our multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On
		  the other hand, our 2D models also make approximations,
		  making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
		  concerning the root of the differences between groups. We
		  discuss some of the diagnostics often employed in the
		  analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
		  relationship between the various explosion conditions that
		  have been proposed. Finally, we explore the ingredients
		  that may be missing in current calculations that may be
		  important in reproducing the properties of the average
		  CCSNe, should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the
		  correct mechanism of explosion.},
