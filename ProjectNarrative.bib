  Abstract	= {We describe the observation of GW170104, a
		  gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a
		  pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured
		  on January 4, 2017 at 10:11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced
		  detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
		  Observatory during their second observing run, with a
		  network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate
		  less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black
		  hole masses are 31. 2-6.0+8.4M&sun; and 19. 4-5.9+5.3
		  M&sun; (at the 90% credible level). The black hole spins
		  are best constrained through measurement of the effective
		  inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the
		  spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane,
		  chieff=-0.1 2-0.30+0.21 . This result implies that spin
		  configurations with both component spins positively aligned
		  with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The
		  source luminosity distance is 88 0-390+450 Mpc
		  corresponding to a redshift of z =0.1 8-0.07+0.08 . We
		  constrain the magnitude of modifications to the
		  gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null
		  tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are
		  dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the
		  graviton mass to mg<=7.7 ×10-23 eV /c2 . In all cases, we
		  find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.},

  Abstract	= {We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations initiated from 12, 15, 20, and 25
		  {M}&sun; zero-age main sequence progenitors. All of the
		  simulations yield explosions and have been evolved for at
		  least 1.2 s after core bounce and 1 s after material first
		  becomes unbound. These simulations were computed with our
		  Chimera code employing RbR spectral neutrino transport,
		  special and general relativistic transport effects, and
		  state-of-the-art neutrino interactions. Continuing the
		  evolution beyond 1 s after core bounce allows the
		  explosions to develop more fully and the processes involved
		  in powering the explosions to become more clearly evident.
		  We compute explosion energy estimates, including the
		  negative gravitational binding energy of the stellar
		  envelope outside the expanding shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38,
		  and 0.70 Bethe (B ≡ {10}51 erg) and increasing at 0.03,
		  0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 {\text{B s}}-1, respectively, for the
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 {M}&sun; models at the endpoint of this
		  report. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in
		  our models through detailed analyses of the energy sources
		  and flows. We discuss how the explosion energies may be
		  subject to stochastic variations as exemplfied by the
		  effect of the explosion geometry of the 20 {M}&sun; model
		  in reducing its explosion energy. We compute the
		  proto-neutron star masses and kick velocities. We compare
		  our results for the explosion energies and ejected {}56{Ni}
		  masses against some observational standards despite the
		  large error bars in both models and observations.},

  Abstract	= {We present a new multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics
		  code for massive stellar core-collapse in full general
		  relativity (GR). Employing an M1 analytical closure scheme,
		  we solve spectral neutrino transport of the radiation
		  energy and momentum based on a truncated moment formalism.
		  Regarding neutrino opacities, we take into account a
		  baseline set in state-of-the-art simulations, in which
		  inelastic neutrino-electron scattering, thermal neutrino
		  production via pair annihilation, and nucleon-nucleon
		  bremsstrahlung are included. While the Einstein field
		  equations and the spatial advection terms in the
		  radiation-hydrodynamics equations are evolved explicitly,
		  the source terms due to neutrino-matter interactions and
		  energy shift in the radiation moment equations are
		  integrated implicitly by an iteration method. To verify our
		  code, we first perform a series of standard radiation tests
		  with analytical solutions that include the check of
		  gravitational redshift and Doppler shift. A good agreement
		  in these tests supports the reliability of the GR
		  multi-energy neutrino transport scheme. We then conduct
		  several test simulations of core-collapse, bounce, and
		  shock stall of a 15{M}&sun; star in the Cartesian
		  coordinates and make a detailed comparison with published
		  results. Our code performs quite well to reproduce the
		  results of full Boltzmann neutrino transport especially
		  before bounce. In the postbounce phase, our code basically
		  performs well, however, there are several differences that
		  are most likely to come from the insufficient spatial
		  resolution in our current 3D-GR models. For clarifying the
		  resolution dependence and extending the code comparison in
		  the late postbounce phase, we discuss that next-generation
		  Exaflops class supercomputers are needed at least.},

  Abstract	= {We present the new code ALCAR developed to model
		  multidimensional, multienergy-group neutrino transport in
		  the context of supernovae and neutron-star mergers. The
		  algorithm solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and
		  first-order angular moments of the specific intensity,
		  supplemented by an algebraic relation for the second-moment
		  tensor to close the system. The scheme takes into account
		  frame-dependent effects of the order O(v/c) as well as the
		  most important types of neutrino interactions. The
		  transport scheme is significantly more efficient than a
		  multidimensional solver of the Boltzmann equation, while it
		  is more accurate and consistent than the flux-limited
		  diffusion method. The finite-volume discretization of the
		  essentially hyperbolic system of moment equations employs
		  methods well-known from hydrodynamics. For the time
		  integration of the potentially stiff moment equations we
		  employ a scheme in which only the local source terms are
		  treated implicitly, while the advection terms are kept
		  explicit, thereby allowing for an efficient computational
		  parallelization of the algorithm. We investigate various
		  problem set-ups in one and two dimensions to verify the
		  implementation and to test the quality of the algebraic
		  closure scheme. In our most detailed test, we compare a
		  fully dynamic, one-dimensional core-collapse simulation
		  with two published calculations performed with well-known
		  Boltzmann-type neutrino-hydrodynamics codes and we find
		  very satisfactory agreement.},

  Abstract	= {We perform the first self-consistent, time-dependent,
		  multi-group calculations in two dimensions (2D) to address
		  the consequences of using the ray-by-ray+ transport
		  simplification in core-collapse supernova simulations. Such
		  a dimensional reduction is employed by many researchers to
		  facilitate their resource-intensive calculations. Our new
		  code (Fornax) implements multi-D transport, and can, by
		  zeroing out transverse flux terms, emulate the ray-by-ray+
		  scheme. Using the same microphysics, initial models,
		  resolution, and code, we compare the results of simulating
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 M &sun; progenitor models using these
		  two transport methods. Our findings call into question the
		  wisdom of the pervasive use of the ray-by-ray+ approach.
		  Employing it leads to maximum post-bounce/pre-explosion
		  shock radii that are almost universally larger by tens of
		  kilometers than those derived using the more accurate
		  scheme, typically leaving the post-bounce matter less bound
		  and artificially more ``explodable.'' In fact, for our 25 M
		  &sun; progenitor, the ray-by-ray+ model explodes, while the
		  corresponding multi-D transport model does not. Therefore,
		  in two dimensions, the combination of ray-by-ray+ with the
		  axial sloshing hydrodynamics that is a feature of 2D
		  supernova dynamics can result in quantitatively, and
		  perhaps qualitatively, incorrect results.},

  Abstract	= {Carefully accounting for neutrino transport is an
		  essential component of many astrophysical studies. Solving
		  the full transport equation is too expensive for most
		  realistic applications, especially those involving multiple
		  spatial dimensions. For such cases, resorting to
		  approximations is often the only viable option for
		  obtaining solutions. One such approximation, which recently
		  became popular, is the M1 method. It utilizes the system of
		  the lowest two moments of the transport equation and closes
		  the system with an ad hoc closure relation. The accuracy of
		  the M1 solution depends on the quality of the closure.
		  Several closures have been proposed in the literature and
		  have been used in various studies. We carry out an
		  extensive study of these closures by comparing the results
		  of M1 calculations with precise Monte Carlo calculations of
		  the radiation field around spherically-symmetric
		  protoneutron star models. We find that no closure performs
		  consistently better or worse than others in all cases. The
		  level of accuracy a given closure yields depends on the
		  matter configuration, neutrino type, and neutrino energy.
		  Given this limitation, the maximum entropy closure by
		  Minerbo (1978) on average yields relatively accurate
		  results in the broadest set of cases considered in this
		  work.},

  Abstract	= {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate
		  Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
		  equations is developed based on the assumption that the
		  normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This
		  assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes
		  Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler
		  equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived
		  that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate
		  states for Bx != 0, whereas the number of the intermediate
		  states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the
		  intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in
		  this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained,
		  the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed
		  straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly
		  resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system,
		  and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands
		  for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that
		  the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the
		  HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver
		  corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic
		  field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD
		  Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the
		  linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally
		  good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in
		  practical applications for the ideal MHD equations.},

		  corrected system is hyperbolic and the density, momentum,
		  magnetic induction, and total energy density are still

  Abstract	= {We present a high-order accurate weighted essentially

		  been successfully applied to hydrodynamic problems. The

		  Details of the WENO scheme as well as the construction of a

  Abstract	= {We present and compare third- as well as fifth-order
		  accurate finite difference schemes for the numerical
		  solution of the compressible ideal MHD equations in

		  four different reconstruction techniques based on recently
		  improved versions of the weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving
		  (MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial
		  reconstruction. The proposed numerical methods are highly
		  accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss of

		  non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities. We suggest
		  a numerical formulation based on a cell-centered approach
		  where all of the primary flow variables are discretized at

  Abstract	= {We explore with self-consistent 2D Fornax simulations the
		  dependence of the outcome of collapse on many-body
		  corrections to neutrino-nucleon cross sections,
		  pre-collapse seed perturbations, and inelastic
		  neutrino-electron and neutrino-nucleon scattering. We show
		  here for the first time that modest many-body corrections
		  to neutrino-nucleon scattering, well-motivated by physics,
		  make explosions easier in models of core-collapse
		  supernovae. In this sense, realistic many-body corrections
		  could be important missing pieces of physics needed to
		  ensure robust supernova explosions. In addition, we find
		  that imposed seed perturbations, while not necessarily
		  determinative of explosion, can facilitate it and shorten
		  its post-bounce emergence time. We now find that all our
		  multi-D models with realistic physics explode by the
		  neutrino heating mechanism. Proximity to criticality
		  amplifies the role of even small changes in the
		  neutrino-matter couplings, and such changes can together
		  add to produce dramatic effects. When close to the critical
		  condition the cumulative result of a few small effects
		  (including seeds) that individually have only modest
		  consequence can convert an anemic into a robust explosion,
		  or even a dud into a blast. Such sensitivity is not seen in
		  one dimension and may explain the apparent heterogeneity in
		  the outcomes of detailed simulations performed
		  internationally. A natural conclusion is that the different
		  groups collectively are closer to a realistic understanding
		  of the mechanism of core-collapse supernovae than might
		  have seemed apparent.},

  Abstract	= {We propose a simple ansatz for estimating the value of the
		  numerical resistivity and the numerical viscosity of any
		  Eulerian MHD code. We test this ansatz with the help of
		  simulations of the propagation of (magneto)sonic waves,
		  Alfven waves, and the tearing mode instability using the
		  MHD code Aenus. By comparing the simu- lation results with
		  analytical solutions of the resistive-viscous MHD equations
		  and an empirical ansatz for the growth rate of tearing
		  modes we measure the numerical viscosity and resistivity of
		  Aenus. The comparison shows that the fast-magnetosonic
		  speed and wavelength are the characteristic velocity and
		  length, respectively, of the aforementioned (relatively
		  simple) systems. We also determine the dependance of the
		  numerical viscosity and resistivity on the time integration
		  method, the spatial reconstruction scheme and (to a lesser
		  extent) the Riemann solver employed in the simulations.
		  From the measured results we infer the numerical resolution
		  (as a function of the spatial reconstruction method)
		  required to properly resolve the growth and saturation
		  level of the magnetic field amplified by the
		  magnetorotational instability in the post-collapsed core of
		  massive stars. Our results show that it is to the best
		  advantage to resort to ultra-high order methods (e.g.,
		  9th-order Monotonicity Preserving method) to tackle this
		  problem properly, in particular in three dimensional
		  simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We introduce an unsplit staggered mesh scheme (USM) for
		  multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) that uses a
		  constrained transport (CT) method with high-order Godunov
		  fluxes and incorporates a new data reconstruction-evolution
		  algorithm for second-order MHD interface states. In this
		  new algorithm, the USM scheme includes so-called
		  "multidimensional MHD terms", proportional to ∇·B, in a
		  dimensionally-unsplit way in a single update. This data
		  reconstruction-evolution step, extended from the corner
		  transport upwind (CTU) approach of Colella, maintains
		  in-plane dynamics very well, as shown by the advection of a
		  very weak magnetic field loop in 2D. This data
		  reconstruction-evolution algorithm is also of advantage in
		  its consistency and simplicity when extended to 3D. The
		  scheme maintains the ∇·B=0 constraint by solving a set
		  of discrete induction equations using the standard CT
		  approach, where the accuracy of the computed electric field
		  directly influences the quality of the magnetic field
		  solution. We address the lack of proper dissipative
		  behavior in the simple electric field averaging scheme and
		  present a new modified electric field construction (MEC)
		  that includes multidimensional derivative information and
		  enhances solution accuracy. A series of comparison studies
		  demonstrates the excellent performance of the full USM-MEC
		  scheme for many stringent multidimensional MHD test
		  problems chosen from the literature. The scheme is
		  implemented and currently freely available in the

  Abstract	= {We describe a single step, second-order accurate Godunov
		  scheme for ideal MHD based on combining the piecewise
		  parabolic method (PPM) for performing spatial
		  reconstruction, the corner transport upwind (CTU) method of
		  Colella for multidimensional integration, and the
		  constrained transport (CT) algorithm for preserving the
		  divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. We adopt
		  the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be
		  represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate
		  that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can
		  be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged
		  field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain
		  simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive
		  new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell
		  corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent
		  one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned
		  flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must
		  include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a
		  number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in
		  order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the
		  results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the
		  method is accurate and robust.},

  Abstract	= {In this article we develop an improved version of the
		  classical fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory
		  finite difference scheme of [G.S. Jiang, C.W. Shu,
		  Efficient implementation of weighted ENO schemes, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 126 (1996) 202-228] (WENO-JS) for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws. Through the novel use of a linear
		  combination of the low order smoothness indicators already
		  present in the framework of WENO-JS, a new smoothness
		  indicator of higher order is devised and new
		  non-oscillatory weights are built, providing a new WENO
		  scheme (WENO-Z) with less dissipation and higher resolution
		  than the classical WENO. This new scheme generates
		  solutions that are sharp as the ones of the mapped WENO
		  scheme (WENO-M) of Henrick et al. [A.K. Henrick, T.D.
		  Aslam, J.M. Powers, Mapped weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory schemes: achieving optimal order near
		  critical points, J. Comput. Phys. 207 (2005) 542-567],
		  however with a 25% reduction in CPU costs, since no mapping
		  is necessary. We also provide a detailed analysis of the
		  convergence of the WENO-Z scheme at critical points of
		  smooth solutions and show that the solution enhancements of
		  WENO-Z and WENO-M at problems with shocks comes from their
		  ability to assign substantially larger weights to
		  discontinuous stencils than the WENO-JS scheme, not from
		  their superior order of convergence at critical points.
		  Numerical solutions of the linear advection of
		  discontinuous functions and nonlinear hyperbolic
		  conservation laws as the one dimensional Euler equations
		  with Riemann initial value problems, the Mach 3
		  shock-density wave interaction and the blastwave problems
		  are compared with the ones generated by the WENO-JS and
		  WENO-M schemes. The good performance of the WENO-Z scheme
		  is also demonstrated in the simulation of two dimensional
		  problems as the shock-vortex interaction and a Mach 4.46
		  Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI) modeled via the two
		  dimensional Euler equations.},

@Article{	  modjaz:2016,
  Abstract	= {We present the first systematic investigation of spectral
		  properties of 17 Type Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic), 10
		  broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-bl) without observed gamma-ray
		  bursts (GRBs), and 11 SNe Ic-bl with GRBs (SN-GRBs) as a
		  function of time in order to probe their explosion
		  conditions and progenitors. Using a number of novel
		  methods, we analyze a total of 407 spectra, which were
		  drawn from published spectra of individual SNe as well as
		  from the densely time-sampled spectra of Modjaz et al
		  (2014). In order to quantify the diversity of the SN
		  spectra as a function of SN subtype, we construct average
		  spectra of SNe Ic, SNe Ic-bl without GRBs, and SNe Ic-bl
		  with GRBs. We find that SN 1994I is not a typical SN Ic,
		  contrasting the general view, while the spectra of SN
		  1998bw/GRB 980425 are representative of mean spectra of SNe
		  Ic-bl. We measure the ejecta absorption and width
		  velocities using a new method described here and find that
		  SNe Ic-bl with GRBs, on average, have quantifiably higher
		  absorption velocities, as well as broader line widths than
		  SNe without observed GRBs. In addition, we search for
		  correlations between SN-GRB spectral properties and the
		  energies of their accompanying GRBs. Finally, we show that
		  the absence of clear He lines in optical spectra of SNe
		  Ic-bl, and in particular of SN-GRBs, is not due to them
		  being too smeared-out due to the high velocities present in
		  the ejecta. This implies that the progenitor stars of
		  SN-GRBs are probably free of the He-layer, in addition to
		  being H-free, which puts strong constraints on the stellar
		  evolutionary paths needed to produce such SN-GRB
		  progenitors at the observed low metallicities.},

  Abstract	= {Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of
		  core-collapse supernovae, and hydrodynamic instabilities
		  play a crucial role in the explosion mechanism. The first
		  successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained
		  with self-consistent, first-principles simulations in three
		  spatial dimensions. But three-dimensional (3D) models tend
		  to be less prone to explosion than the corresponding
		  axisymmetric two-dimensional (2D) ones. The reason is that
		  3D turbulence leads to energy cascading from large to small
		  spatial scales, the inverse of the 2D case, thus
		  disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest
		  scales. Unless the inertia to explode simply reflects a
		  lack of sufficient resolution in relevant regions, some
		  important component of robust and sufficiently energetic
		  neutrino-powered explosions may still be missing. Such a
		  deficit could be associated with progenitor properties such
		  as rotation, magnetic fields, or precollapse perturbations,
		  or with microphysics that could cause enhancement of
		  neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also
		  revealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D ones,
		  such as spiral modes of the standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar lepton-number
		  emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time-
		  and direction-dependent variations on the detectable
		  neutrino signal. The understanding of these effects and of
		  their consequences is still in its infancy.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first 4pi-three-dimensional (3D) simulation
		  of the last minutes of oxygen shell burning in an 18 M
		  &sun; supernova progenitor up to the onset of core
		  collapse. A moving inner boundary is used to accurately
		  model the contraction of the silicon and iron core
		  according to a one-dimensional stellar evolution model with
		  a self-consistent treatment of core deleptonization and
		  nuclear quasi-equilibrium. The simulation covers the full
		  solid angle to allow the emergence of large-scale
		  convective modes. Due to core contraction and the
		  concomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective
		  Mach number increases to ˜0.1 at collapse, and an l = 2
		  mode emerges shortly before the end of the simulation.
		  Aside from a growth of the oxygen shell from 0.51 M &sun;
		  to 0.56 M &sun; due to entrainment from the carbon shell,
		  the convective flow is reasonably well described by
		  mixing-length theory, and the dominant scales are
		  compatible with estimates from linear stability analysis.
		  We deduce that artificial changes in the physics, such as
		  accelerated core contraction, can have precarious
		  consequences for the state of convection at collapse. We
		  argue that scaling laws for the convective velocities and
		  eddy sizes furnish good estimates for the state of shell
		  convection at collapse and develop a simple analytic theory
		  for the impact of convective seed perturbations on shock
		  revival in the ensuing supernova. We predict a reduction of
		  the critical luminosity for explosion by 12%-24% due to
		  seed asphericities for our 3D progenitor model relative to
		  the case without large seed perturbations.},

  Abstract	= {We report on a set of long-term general-relativistic
		  three-dimensional (3D) multi-group (energy-dependent)
		  neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of
		  core-collapse supernovae. We employ a full 3D two-moment
		  scheme with the local M1 closure, three neutrino species,
		  and 12 energy groups per species. With this, we follow the
		  post-core-bounce evolution of the core of a nonrotating 27
		  - {M}&sun; progenitor in full unconstrained 3D and in
		  octant symmetry for ≳380 ms. We find the development of
		  an asymmetric runaway explosion in our unconstrained
		  simulation. We test the resolution dependence of our
		  results and, in agreement with previous work, find that low
		  resolution artificially aids explosion and leads to an
		  earlier runaway expansion of the shock. At low resolution,
		  the octant and full 3D dynamics are qualitatively very
		  similar, but at high resolution, only the full 3D
		  simulation exhibits the onset of explosion.},

  Abstract	= {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of
		  the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
		  simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave
		  signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to
		  250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0
		  ×10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general
		  relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black
		  holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole.
		  The signal was observed with a matched-filter
		  signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate
		  estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years,
		  equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 sigma . The
		  source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0-180+160 Mpc
		  corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9-0.04+0.03 . In the
		  source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3
		  6-4+5M&sun; and 2 9-4+4M&sun; , and the final black hole
		  mass is 6 2-4+4M&sun; , with 3. 0-0.5+0.5M&sun; c2 radiated
		  in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90%
		  credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the
		  existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This
		  is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and

  Abstract	= {Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many
		  high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can
		  amplify the local magnetic field over very short
		  timescales. Specifically, the magnetorotational instability
		  and dynamo action have been suggested as a mechanism for
		  the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 1015
		  gauss and above) and for powering the explosion of a
		  rotating massive star. Such stars are candidate progenitors
		  of type Ic-bl hypernovae, which make up all supernovae that
		  are connected to long gamma-ray bursts. The
		  magnetorotational instability has been studied with local
		  high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three
		  dimensions, and with global two-dimensional simulations,
		  but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this
		  instability can result in the creation of a large-scale,
		  ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report
		  results from global, three-dimensional,
		  general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence
		  simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in
		  rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse
		  cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal
		  field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar
		  magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results
		  demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are
		  plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae and
		  long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for
		  the formation of magnetars. Moreover, our findings suggest
		  that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind
		  potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae.},

  Abstract	= {We present results from high-resolution semiglobal
		  simulations of neutrino-driven convection in core-collapse
		  supernovae. We employ an idealized setup with parameterized
		  neutrino heating/cooling and nuclear dissociation at the
		  shock front. We study the internal dynamics of
		  neutrino-driven convection and its role in redistributing
		  energy and momentum through the gain region. We find that
		  even if buoyant plumes are able to locally transfer heat up
		  to the shock, convection is not able to create a net
		  positive energy flux and overcome the downward transport of
		  energy from the accretion flow. Turbulent convection does,
		  however, provide a significant effective pressure support
		  to the accretion flow as it favors the accumulation of
		  energy, mass, and momentum in the gain region. We derive an
		  approximate equation that is able to explain and predict
		  the shock evolution in terms of integrals of quantities
		  such as the turbulent pressure in the gain region or the
		  effects of nonradial motion of the fluid. We use this
		  relation as a way to quantify the role of turbulence in the
		  dynamics of the accretion shock. Finally, we investigate
		  the effects of grid resolution, which we change by a factor
		  of 20 between the lowest and highest resolution. Our
		  results show that the shallow slopes of the turbulent
		  kinetic energy spectra reported in previous studies are a
		  numerical artifact. Kolmogorov scaling is progressively
		  recovered as the resolution is increased.},

  Abstract	= {A new integration method combining the ADER time
		  discretization with a multi-moment finite-volume framework
		  is introduced. ADER runtime is reduced by performing only
		  one Cauchy-Kowalewski (C-K) procedure per cell per time
		  step and by using the Differential Transform Method for
		  high-order derivatives. Three methods are implemented: (1)
		  single-moment WENO (WENO), (2) two-moment Hermite WENO
		  (HWENO), and (3) entirely local multi-moment (MM-Loc).
		  MM-Loc evolves all moments, sharing the locality of
		  Galerkin methods yet with a constant time step during
		  p-refinement. Five 1-D experiments validate the methods:
		  (1) linear advection, (2) Burger's equation shock, (3)
		  transient shallow-water (SW), (4) steady-state SW
		  simulation, and (5) SW shock. WENO and HWENO methods showed
		  expected polynomial h-refinement convergence and
		  successfully limited oscillations for shock experiments.
		  MM-Loc showed expected polynomial h-refinement and
		  exponential p-refinement convergence for linear advection
		  and showed sub-exponential (yet super-polynomial)
		  convergence with p-refinement in the SW case. HWENO
		  accuracy was generally equal to or better than a
		  five-moment MM-Loc scheme. MM-Loc was less accurate than
		  RKDG at lower refinements, but with greater h- and
		  p-convergence, RKDG accuracy is eventually surpassed. The
		  ADER time integrator of MM-Loc also proved more accurate
		  with p-refinement at a CFL of unity than a semi-discrete RK
		  analog of MM-Loc. Being faster in serial and requiring less
		  frequent inter-node communication than Galerkin methods,
		  the ADER-based MM-Loc and HWENO schemes can be spatially
		  refined and have the same runtime, making them a
		  competitive option for further investigation.},

@Article{	  seal:2014a,
  Abstract	= {High-order temporal discretizations for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws have historically been formulated as
		  either a method of lines (MOL) or a Lax-Wendroff method. In
		  the MOL viewpoint, the partial differential equation is
		  treated as a large system of ordinary differential
		  equations (ODEs), where an ODE tailored time-integrator is
		  applied. In contrast, Lax-Wendroff discretizations
		  immediately convert Taylor series in time to discrete
		  spatial derivatives. In this work, we propose the Picard
		  integral formulation (PIF), which is based on the method of
		  modified fluxes, and is used to derive new Taylor and
		  Runge-Kutta (RK) methods. In particular, we construct a new
		  class of conservative finite difference methods by applying
		  WENO reconstructions to the so-called "time-averaged"
		  fluxes. Our schemes are automatically conservative under
		  any modification of the fluxes, which is attributed to the
		  fact that classical WENO reconstructions conserve mass when
		  coupled with forward Euler time steps. The proposed
		  Lax-Wendroff discretization is constructed by taking Taylor
		  series of the flux function as opposed to Taylor series of
		  the conserved variables. The RK discretization differs from
		  classical MOL formulations because we apply WENO
		  reconstructions to time-averaged fluxes rather than taking
		  linear combinations of spatial derivatives of the flux. In
		  both cases, we only need one projection onto the
		  characteristic variables per time step. The PIF is generic,
		  and lends itself to a multitude of options for further
		  investigation. At present, we present two canonical
		  examples: one based on Taylor, and the other based on the
		  classical RK method. Stability analyses are presented for
		  each method. The proposed schemes are applied to hyperbolic
		  conservation laws in one- and two-dimensions and the
		  results are in good agreement with current state of the art
		  methods.},

  Abstract	= {We propose a high-order finite difference weighted ENO
		  (WENO) method for the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)
		  equations. The proposed method is single-stage (i.e., it
		  has no internal stages to store), single-step (i.e., it has
		  no time history that needs to be stored), maintains a
		  discrete divergence-free condition on the magnetic field,
		  and has the capacity to preserve the positivity of the
		  density and pressure. To accomplish this, we use a Taylor
		  discretization of the Picard integral formulation (PIF) of
		  the finite difference WENO method proposed in Christlieb et
		  al. (2015) [23], where the focus is on a high-order
		  discretization of the fluxes (as opposed to the conserved
		  variables). We use the version where fluxes are expanded to
		  third-order accuracy in time, and for the fluid variables
		  space is discretized using the classical fifth-order finite
		  difference WENO discretization. We use constrained
		  transport in order to obtain divergence-free magnetic
		  fields, which means that we simultaneously evolve the
		  magnetohydrodynamic (that has an evolution equation for the
		  magnetic field) and magnetic potential equations alongside
		  each other, and set the magnetic field to be the (discrete)
		  curl of the magnetic potential after each time step. In
		  this work, we compute these derivatives to fourth-order
		  accuracy. In order to retain a single-stage, single-step
		  method, we develop a novel Lax-Wendroff discretization for
		  the evolution of the magnetic potential, where we start
		  with technology used for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in order
		  to construct a non-oscillatory magnetic field. The end
		  result is an algorithm that is similar to our previous work
		  Christlieb et al. (2014) [8], but this time the time
		  stepping is replaced through a Taylor method with the
		  addition of a positivity-preserving limiter. Finally,
		  positivity preservation is realized by introducing a
		  parameterized flux limiter that considers a linear
		  combination of high and low-order numerical fluxes. The
		  choice of the free parameter is then given in such a way
		  that the fluxes are limited towards the low-order solver
		  until positivity is attained. Given the lack of additional
		  degrees of freedom in the system, this positivity limiter
		  lacks energy conservation where the limiter turns on.
		  However, this ingredient can be dropped for problems where
		  the pressure does not become negative. We present two and
		  three dimensional numerical results for several standard
		  test problems including a smooth Alfv{\'e}n wave (to verify
		  formal order of accuracy), shock tube problems (to test the
		  shock-capturing ability of the scheme), Orszag-Tang, and
		  cloud shock interactions. These results assert the
		  robustness and verify the high-order of accuracy of the
		  proposed scheme.},

@Article{	  christlieb:2014,
  Abstract	= {In this work we develop a class of high-order finite
		  difference weighted essentially non-oscillatory (FD-WENO)
		  schemes for solving the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
		  equations in 2D and 3D. The philosophy of this work is to
		  use efficient high-order WENO spatial discretizations with
		  high-order strong stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (SSP-RK)
		  time-stepping schemes. Numerical results have shown that
		  with such methods we are able to resolve solution
		  structures that are only visible at much higher grid
		  resolutions with lower-order schemes. The key challenge in
		  applying such methods to ideal MHD is to control divergence
		  errors in the magnetic field. We achieve this by augmenting
		  the base scheme with a novel high-order constrained
		  transport approach that updates the magnetic vector
		  potential. The predicted magnetic field from the base
		  scheme is replaced by a divergence-free magnetic field that
		  is obtained from the curl of this magnetic potential. The
		  non-conservative weakly hyperbolic system that the magnetic
		  vector potential satisfies is solved using a version of
		  FD-WENO developed for Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The
		  resulting numerical method is endowed with several
		  important properties: (1) all quantities, including all
		  components of the magnetic field and magnetic potential,
		  are treated as point values on the same mesh (i.e., there
		  is no mesh staggering); (2) both the spatial and temporal
		  orders of accuracy are fourth-order; (3) no spatial
		  integration or multidimensional reconstructions are needed
		  in any step; and (4) special limiters in the magnetic
		  vector potential update are used to control unphysical
		  oscillations in the magnetic field. Several 2D and 3D
		  numerical examples are presented to verify the order of
		  accuracy on smooth test problems and to show
		  high-resolution on test problems that involve shocks.},

  Abstract	= {In this paper, we extend the unsplit staggered mesh scheme
		  (USM) for 2D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [D. Lee, A.E.
		  Deane, An unsplit staggered mesh scheme for
		  multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 228
		  (2009) 952-975] to a full 3D MHD scheme. The scheme is a
		  finite-volume Godunov method consisting of a constrained
		  transport (CT) method and an efficient and accurate
		  single-step, directionally unsplit multidimensional data
		  reconstruction-evolution algorithm, which extends Colella's
		  original 2D corner transport upwind (CTU) method [P.
		  Colella, Multidimensional upwind methods for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 87 (1990) 446-466]. We
		  present two types of data reconstruction-evolution
		  algorithms for 3D: (1) a reduced CTU scheme and (2) a full
		  CTU scheme. The reduced 3D CTU scheme is a variant of a
		  simple 3D extension of Collela's 2D CTU method and is
		  considered as a direct extension from the 2D USM scheme.
		  The full 3D CTU scheme is our primary 3D solver which
		  includes all multidimensional cross-derivative terms for
		  stability. The latter method is logically analogous to the
		  3D unsplit CTU method by Saltzman [J. Saltzman, An unsplit
		  3D upwind method for hyperbolic conservation laws, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 115 (1994) 153-168]. The major novelties in
		  our algorithms are twofold. First, we extend the reduced
		  CTU scheme to the full CTU scheme which is able to run with
		  CFL numbers close to unity. Both methods utilize the
		  transverse update technique developed in the 2D USM
		  algorithm to account for transverse fluxes without solving
		  intermediate Riemann problems, which in turn gives
		  cost-effective 3D methods by reducing the total number of
		  Riemann solves. The proposed algorithms are simple and
		  efficient especially when including multidimensional MHD
		  terms that maintain in-plane magnetic field dynamics.
		  Second, we introduce a new CT scheme that makes use of
		  proper upwind information in taking averages of electric
		  fields. Our 3D USM schemes can be easily combined with
		  various reconstruction methods (e.g., first-order Godunov,
		  second-order MUSCL-Hancock, third-order PPM and fifth-order
		  WENO), and a wide choice of 1D based Riemann solvers (e.g.,
		  local Lax-Friedrichs, HLLE, HLLC, HLLD, and Roe). The 3D
		  USM-MHD solver is available in the University of Chicago
		  Flash Center's official FLASH release.},

  Abstract	= {FLASH is a publicly available high performance application

		  system from a collection of unconnected legacy codes. FLASH
		  has been successful because its capabilities have been
		  driven by the needs of scientific applications, without
		  compromising maintainability, performance, and usability.
		  In its newest incarnation, FLASH3 consists of
		  inter-operable modules that can be combined to generate
		  different applications. The FLASH architecture allows
		  arbitrarily many alternative implementations of its
		  components to co-exist and interchange with each other,
		  resulting in greater flexibility. Further, a simple and
		  elegant mechanism exists for customization of code
		  functionality without the need to modify the core
		  implementation of the source. A built-in unit test
		  framework providing verifiability, combined with a rigorous
		  software maintenance process, allow the code to operate
		  simultaneously in the dual mode of production and
		  development. In this paper we describe the FLASH3
		  architecture, with emphasis on solutions to the more
		  challenging conflicts arising from solver complexity,
		  portable performance requirements, and legacy codes. We

  Abstract	= {In the implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) paradigm, the
		  dissipative nature of high-resolution shock-capturing
		  schemes is exploited to provide an implicit model of
		  turbulence. The ILES approach has been applied to different
		  contexts, with varying degrees of success. It is the
		  de-facto standard in many astrophysical simulations and in
		  particular in studies of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN).
		  Recent 3D simulations suggest that turbulence might play a
		  crucial role in core-collapse supernova explosions, however
		  the fidelity with which turbulence is simulated in these
		  studies is unclear. Especially considering that the
		  accuracy of ILES for the regime of interest in CCSN, weakly
		  compressible and strongly anisotropic, has not been
		  systematically assessed before. Anisotropy, in particular,
		  could impact the dissipative properties of the flow and
		  enhance the turbulent pressure in the radial direction,
		  favouring the explosion. In this paper we assess the
		  accuracy of ILES using numerical methods most commonly
		  employed in computational astrophysics by means of a number
		  of local simulations of driven, weakly compressible,
		  anisotropic turbulence. Our simulations employ several
		  different methods and span a wide range of resolutions. We
		  report a detailed analysis of the way in which the
		  turbulent cascade is influenced by the numerics. Our
		  results suggest that anisotropy and compressibility in CCSN
		  turbulence have little effect on the turbulent kinetic
		  energy spectrum and a Kolmogorov scaling is obtained in the
		  inertial range. We find that, on the one hand, the kinetic
		  energy dissipation rate at large scales is correctly
		  captured even at low resolutions, suggesting that very high
		  "effective Reynolds number" can be achieved at the largest
		  scales of the simulation. On the other hand, the dynamics
		  at intermediate scales appears to be completely dominated
		  by the so-called bottleneck effect, i.e., the pile up of
		  kinetic energy close to the dissipation range due to the
		  partial suppression of the energy cascade by numerical
		  viscosity. An inertial range is not recovered until the
		  point where high resolution ˜5123, which would be
		  difficult to realize in global simulations, is reached. We
		  discuss the consequences for CCSN simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We substantially update the capabilities of the
		  open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in
		  Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously
		  evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars
		  undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum,
		  greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary
		  evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled
		  calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes
		  now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning
		  stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models.
		  Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with
		  MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star
		  lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of
		  core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting
		  explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation
		  instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the
		  instability strips for massive stars while also
		  accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology
		  data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving
		  more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA
		  capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly''
		  from input nuclear data allows better simulation of
		  accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the
		  fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing
		  challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled
		  plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now
		  allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy
		  elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA
		  software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency
		  for all results across all the supported platforms, a
		  profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's

  Abstract	= {We conduct a series of numerical experiments into the
		  nature of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics in the
		  postbounce stalled-shock phase of core-collapse supernovae
		  using 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of a
		  27 M&sun; progenitor star with a neutrino leakage/heating
		  scheme. We vary the strength of neutrino heating and find
		  three cases of 3D dynamics: (1) neutrino-driven convection,
		  (2) initially neutrino-driven convection and subsequent
		  development of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI), and (3) SASI-dominated evolution. This confirms
		  previous 3D results of Hanke et al. and Couch & Connor. We
		  carry out simulations with resolutions differing by up to a
		  factor of ˜4 and demonstrate that low resolution is
		  artificially favorable for explosion in the 3D
		  convection-dominated case since it decreases the efficiency
		  of energy transport to small scales. Low resolution results
		  in higher radial convective fluxes of energy and enthalpy,
		  more fully buoyant mass, and stronger neutrino heating. In
		  the SASI-dominated case, lower resolution damps SASI
		  oscillations. In the convection-dominated case, a
		  quasi-stationary angular kinetic energy spectrum E(l)
		  develops in the heating layer. Like other 3D studies, we
		  find E(l) ∝l-1 in the ``inertial range,'' while theory
		  and local simulations argue for E(l) ∝ l-5/3. We argue
		  that current 3D simulations do not resolve the inertial
		  range of turbulence and are affected by numerical viscosity
		  up to the energy-containing scale, creating a
		  ``bottleneck'' that prevents an efficient turbulent
		  cascade.},

  Abstract	= {We have performed ab initio neutrino radiation
		  hydrodynamics simulations in three and two spatial
		  dimensions (3D and 2D) of core-collapse supernovae from the
		  same 15 M&sun; progenitor through 440 ms after core bounce.
		  Both 3D and 2D models achieve explosions; however, the
		  onset of explosion (shock revival) is delayed by ~100 ms in
		  3D relative to the 2D counterpart and the growth of the
		  diagnostic explosion energy is slower. This is consistent
		  with previously reported 3D simulations utilizing iron-core
		  progenitors with dense mantles. In the ~100 ms before the
		  onset of explosion, diagnostics of neutrino heating and
		  turbulent kinetic energy favor earlier explosion in 2D.
		  During the delay, the angular scale of convective plumes
		  reaching the shock surface grows and explosion in 3D is
		  ultimately lead by a single, large-angle plume, giving the
		  expanding shock a directional orientation not dissimilar

  Abstract	= {Interactions with neutrons and protons play a crucial role
		  for the neutrino opacity of matter in the supernova core.
		  Their current implementation in many simulation codes,
		  however, is rather schematic and ignores not only
		  modifications for the correlated nuclear medium of the
		  nascent neutron star, but also free-space corrections from
		  nucleon recoil, weak magnetism, or strange quarks, which
		  can easily add up to changes of several 10% for neutrino
		  energies in the spectral peak. In the Garching supernova
		  simulations with the Prometheus-Vertex code, such
		  sophistications have been included for a long time except
		  for the strange-quark contributions to the nucleon spin,
		  which affect neutral-current neutrino scattering. We
		  demonstrate on the basis of a 20 {M}o progenitor star that
		  a moderate strangeness-dependent contribution of
		  {g}{{a}}{{s}}=-0.2 to the axial-vector coupling constant
		  {g}{{a}}≈ 1.26 can turn an unsuccessful three-dimensional
		  (3D) model into a successful explosion. Such a modification
		  is in the direction of current experimental results and
		  reduces the neutral-current scattering opacity of neutrons,
		  which dominate in the medium around and above the
		  neutrinosphere. This leads to increased luminosities and
		  mean energies of all neutrino species and strengthens the
		  neutrino-energy deposition in the heating layer. Higher
		  nonradial kinetic energy in the gain layer signals enhanced
		  buoyancy activity that enables the onset of the explosion
		  at ~300 ms after bounce, in contrast to the model with
		  vanishing strangeness contributions to neutrino--nucleon
		  scattering. Our results demonstrate the close proximity to
		  explosion of the previously published, unsuccessful 3D
		  models of the Garching group.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulation of
		  the final minutes of iron core growth in a massive star, up
		  to and including the point of core gravitational
		  instability and collapse. We capture the development of
		  strong convection driven by violent Si burning in the shell
		  surrounding the iron core. This convective burning builds
		  the iron core to its critical mass and collapse ensues,
		  driven by electron capture and photodisintegration. The
		  non-spherical structure and motion generated by 3D
		  convection is substantial at the point of collapse, with
		  convective speeds of several hundreds of km s-1. We examine
		  the impact of such physically realistic 3D initial
		  conditions on the core-collapse supernova mechanism using
		  3D simulations including multispecies neutrino leakage and
		  find that the enhanced post-shock turbulence resulting from
		  3D progenitor structure aids successful explosions. We

  Abstract	= {We present the first two-dimensional general relativistic
		  (GR) simulations of stellar core collapse and explosion
		  with the COCONUT hydrodynamics code in combination with the
		  VERTEX solver for energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino
		  transport, using the extended conformal flatness condition
		  for approximating the space-time metric and a
		  ray-by-ray-plus ansatz to tackle the multi-dimensionality
		  of the transport. For both of the investigated 11.2 and 15
		  M &sun; progenitors we obtain successful, though seemingly
		  marginal, neutrino-driven supernova explosions. This
		  outcome and the time evolution of the models basically
		  agree with results previously obtained with the PROMETHEUS
		  hydro solver including an approximative treatment of
		  relativistic effects by a modified Newtonian potential.
		  However, GR models exhibit subtle differences in the
		  neutrinospheric conditions compared with Newtonian and
		  pseudo-Newtonian simulations. These differences lead to
		  significantly higher luminosities and mean energies of the
		  radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and therefore
		  to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies
		  in the gain layer with favorable consequences for strong
		  nonradial mass motions and ultimately for an explosion.
		  Moreover, energy transfer to the stellar medium around the
		  neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering
		  reactions of heavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the
		  mentioned effects. Together with previous pseudo-Newtonian
		  models, the presented relativistic calculations suggest
		  that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging
		  neutrino interactions can make differences of even 50%-100%
		  in some quantities and is likely to contribute to a finally
		  successful explosion mechanism on no minor level than
		  hydrodynamical differences between different dimensions.},

  Abstract	= {A major goal over the last decade has been understanding
		  which multidimensional effects are crucial in facilitating
		  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions. Unfortunately,
		  much of this work has necessarily assumed axisymmetry. In
		  this work, we present analyses of simplified
		  two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) CCSN models
		  with the goal of comparing the hydrodynamics in setups that
		  differ only in dimension. Not surprisingly, we find many
		  differences between 2D and 3D models. While some
		  differences are subtle and perhaps not crucial, others are
		  dramatic and make interpreting 2D models problematic. In
		  particular, axisymmetric models produce excess power at the
		  largest spatial scales, power that has been deemed critical
		  in previous explosion models. Nevertheless, our 3D models,
		  which have an order of magnitude less power than 2D models
		  on large scales, explode earlier. Since explosions occur
		  earlier in 3D than in 2D, the vigorous large-scale sloshing
		  is either not critical in any dimension or the explosion
		  mechanism operates differently in 2D and 3D. On the other
		  hand, we find that the average parcel of matter in the gain
		  region has been exposed to net heating for up to 30% longer
		  in 3D than in 2D, an effect we attribute to the differing
		  characters of turbulence in 2D and 3D. We suggest that this
		  effect plays a prominent role in producing earlier
		  explosions in 3D. Finally, we discuss a simple model for
		  the runaway growth of buoyant bubbles that is able to
		  quantitatively account for the growth of the shock radius
		  and predicts a critical luminosity relation.},

		  Hydrodynamic instabilities that impart substantial

@Article{	  hanke:2012,
  Abstract	= {Following a simulation approach of recent publications, we
		  explore the viability of the neutrino-heating explosion
		  mechanism's dependence on the spatial dimension. Our
		  results disagree with previous findings. While we also
		  observe that two-dimensional (2D) models explode for lower
		  driving neutrino luminosity than spherically symmetric (1D)
		  models, we do not find that explosions in 3D occur easier
		  and earlier than in 2D. Moreover, we find that the average
		  entropy of matter in the gain layer hardly depends on the
		  dimension and thus is not a good diagnostic quantity for
		  the readiness to explode. Instead, mass, integrated
		  entropy, total neutrino-heating rate, and non-radial
		  kinetic energy in the gain layer are higher when models are
		  closer to explosion. Coherent, large-scale mass motions as
		  typically associated with the standing accretion-shock
		  instability (SASI) are observed to be supportive for
		  explosions because they drive strong shock expansion and
		  thus enlarge the gain layer. While 2D models with better
		  angular resolution clearly explode more easily, the
		  opposite trend is seen in 3D. We interpret this as a
		  consequence of the turbulent energy cascade, which
		  transports energy from small to large spatial scales in 2D,
		  thus fostering SASI activity. In contrast, the energy flow
		  in 3D is in the opposite direction, feeding fragmentation
		  and vortex motions on smaller scales and thus making the 3D
		  evolution with finer grid resolution more similar to 1D.
		  More favorable conditions for explosions in 3D may

  Abstract	= {We explore the dependence on spatial dimension of the
		  viability of the neutrino heating mechanism of
		  core-collapse supernova explosions. We find that the
		  tendency to explode is a monotonically increasing function
		  of dimension, with three dimensions (3D) requiring ~40%-50%
		  lower driving neutrino luminosity than one dimension and
		  ~15%-25% lower driving neutrino luminosity than two
		  dimensions (2D). Moreover, we find that the delay to
		  explosion for a given neutrino luminosity is always shorter
		  in 3D than 2D, sometimes by many hundreds of milliseconds.
		  The magnitude of this dimensional effect is much larger
		  than the purported magnitude of a variety of other effects,
		  such as nuclear burning, inelastic scattering, or general
		  relativity, which are sometimes invoked to bridge the gap
		  between the current ambiguous and uncertain theoretical
		  situation and the fact of robust supernova explosions.
		  Since real supernovae occur in three dimensions, our
		  finding may be an important step toward unraveling one of
		  the most problematic puzzles in stellar astrophysics. In
		  addition, even though in 3D, we do see pre-explosion
		  instabilities and blast asymmetries, unlike the situation
		  in 2D, we do not see an obvious axially symmetric dipolar
		  shock oscillation. Rather, the free energy available to
		  power instabilities seems to be shared by more and more
		  degrees of freedom as the dimension increases. Hence, the
		  strong dipolar axisymmetry seen in 2D and previously
		  identified as a fundamental characteristic of the shock
		  hydrodynamics may not survive in 3D as a prominent
		  feature.},

  Abstract	= {The relevance of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI) compared to neutrino-driven convection in
		  three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core environments is still
		  highly controversial. Studying a 27 M &sun; progenitor, we
		  demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity
		  can develop in 3D simulations with detailed neutrino
		  transport despite the presence of convection. This result
		  was obtained with the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code with the same
		  sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in
		  one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) models. While
		  buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass
		  motions in the postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with
		  growing amplitude sets in during a phase of shock
		  retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose
		  growth is only quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO
		  interface leads to strong shock expansion in response to a
		  dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the phase
		  of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the
		  postshock layer exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by
		  the lowest-order spherical harmonics (l = 1, m = 0, $\pm$1)
		  in distinct contrast to the higher multipole structures
		  associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that
		  the SASI amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic
		  energy in three dimensions can exceed those of the
		  corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the
		  evolution. We also perform parameterized 3D simulations of
		  a 25 M &sun; progenitor, using a simplified, gray neutrino
		  transport scheme, an axis-free Yin-Yang grid, and different
		  amplitudes of random seed perturbations. They confirm the
		  importance of the SASI for another progenitor, its
		  independence of the choice of spherical grid, and its
		  preferred growth for fast accretion flows connected to
		  small shock radii and compact proto-neutron stars as
		  previously found in 2D setups.},

  Abstract	= {Self-gravity computation by multipole expansion is a
		  common approach in problems such as core-collapse and Type
		  Ia supernovae, where single large condensations of mass
		  must be treated. The standard formulation of multipole
		  self-gravity in arbitrary coordinate systems suffers from
		  two significant sources of error, which we correct in the
		  formulation presented in this article. The first source of
		  error is due to the numerical approximation that
		  effectively places grid cell mass at the central point of
		  the cell, then computes the gravitational potential at that
		  point, resulting in a convergence failure of the multipole
		  expansion. We describe a new scheme that avoids this
		  problem by computing gravitational potential at cell faces.
		  The second source of error is due to sub-optimal choice of
		  location for the expansion center, which results in angular
		  power at high multipole l values in the gravitational
		  field, requiring a high---and expensive---value of
		  multipole cutoff l max. By introducing a global measure of
		  angular power in the gravitational field, we show that the
		  optimal coordinate for the expansion is the
		  square-density-weighted mean location. We subject our new
		  multipole self-gravity algorithm, implemented in the FLASH
		  simulation framework, to two rigorous test problems:
		  MacLaurin spheroids for which exact analytic solutions are
		  known, and core-collapse supernovae. We show that key
		  observables of the core-collapse simulations, particularly
		  shock expansion, proto-neutron star motion, and momentum
		  conservation, are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of
		  the multipole gravity, and the accuracy of their
		  computation is greatly improved by our reformulated

		  expands to a maximum radius of 350 km instead of only ~240
		  km as in a comparable calculation with multigroup

		  due to the more accurate transport in our model.
		  Nevertheless, after 180 ms of expansion the shock finally
		  recedes to a radius around 250 km (compared to ~170 km in

		  core-collapse supernovae including a parameterized neutrino
		  heating and cooling scheme in order to investigate the
		  critical core neutrino luminosity (L crit) required for
		  explosion. In contrast to some previous works, we find that
		  3D simulations explode later than 2D simulations, and that
		  L crit at fixed mass accretion rate is somewhat higher in
		  three dimensions than in two dimensions. We find, however,
		  that in two dimensions L crit increases as the numerical
		  resolution of the simulation increases. In contrast to some
		  previous works, we argue that the average entropy of the
		  gain region is in fact not a good indicator of explosion
		  but is rather a reflection of the greater mass in the gain
		  region in two dimensions. We compare our simulations to
		  semi-analytic explosion criteria and examine the nature of
		  the convective motions in two dimensions and three
		  dimensions. We discuss the balance between neutrino-driven
		  buoyancy and drag forces. In particular, we show that the
		  drag force will be proportional to a buoyant plume's
		  surface area while the buoyant force is proportional to a

		  work, a linear analysis is presented of the instability,
		  which is local and extremely powerful; the maximum growth
		  rate, which is of the order of the angular rotation
		  velocity, is independent of the strength of the magnetic
		  field. Fluid motions associated with the instability
		  directly generate both poloidal and toroidal field
		  components. In the second part of this investigation, the
		  scaling relation between the instability's wavenumber and

  Abstract	= {We present results of a systematic study of failing
		  core-collapse supernovae and the formation of stellar-mass
		  black holes (BHs). Using our open-source
		  general-relativistic 1.5D code GR1D equipped with a
		  three-species neutrino leakage/heating scheme and over 100
		  presupernova models, we study the effects of the choice of
		  nuclear equation of state (EOS), zero-age main sequence
		  (ZAMS) mass and metallicity, rotation, and mass-loss
		  prescription on BH formation. We find that the outcome, for
		  a given EOS, can be estimated, to first order, by a single
		  parameter, the compactness of the stellar core at bounce.
		  By comparing protoneutron star (PNS) structure at the onset
		  of gravitational instability with solutions of the
		  Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations, we find that thermal
		  pressure support in the outer PNS core is responsible for
		  raising the maximum PNS mass by up to 25% above the cold NS
		  value. By artificially increasing neutrino heating, we find
		  the critical neutrino heating efficiency required for
		  exploding a given progenitor structure and connect these
		  findings with ZAMS conditions, establishing, albeit
		  approximately, for the first time based on actual collapse
		  simulations, the mapping between ZAMS parameters and the
		  outcome of core collapse. We also study the effect of

  Abstract	= {We substantially update the capabilities of the open

		  evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's
		  ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends
		  its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that

		  enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions
		  motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic
		  pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a
		  numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more
		  easily implemented when many nuclei are present at
		  non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which
		  MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
		  mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M &sun; stars
		  through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal
		  pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We
		  implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical
		  abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star
		  models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
		  introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes
		  that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to
		  core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of

		  one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar,
		  combines many of the numerical and physics modules for

		  It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep
		  controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on
		  OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state,
		  opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
		  and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is
		  constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own
		  explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
		  independent development. Several detailed examples indicate
		  the extensive verification and testing that is continuously
		  performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities
		  that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
		  tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant
		  planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track

  Abstract	= {We describe the results of 3D numerical simulations of
		  oxygen shell burning and hydrogen core burning in a 23
		  Msolar stellar model. A detailed comparison is made to
		  stellar mixing-length theory (MLT) for the shell-burning
		  model. Simulations in 2D are significantly different from
		  3D, in terms of both flow morphology and velocity
		  amplitude. Convective mixing regions are better predicted
		  using a dynamic boundary condition based on the bulk
		  Richardson number than by purely local, static criteria
		  like Schwarzschild or Ledoux. MLT gives a good description
		  of the velocity scale and temperature gradient for shell
		  convection; however, there are other important effects that
		  it does not capture, mostly related to the dynamical motion
		  of the boundaries between convective and nonconvective
		  regions. There is asymmetry between upflows and downflows,
		  so the net kinetic energy flux is not zero. The motion of
		  convective boundaries is a source of gravity waves; this is
		  a necessary consequence of the deceleration of convective
		  plumes. Convective ``overshooting'' is best described as an
		  elastic response by the convective boundary, rather than
		  ballistic penetration of the stable layers by turbulent
		  eddies. The convective boundaries are rife with internal
		  and interfacial wave motions, and a variety of
		  instabilities arise that induce mixing through a process
		  best described as turbulent entrainment. We find that the
		  rate at which material entrainment proceeds at the
		  boundaries is consistent with analogous laboratory
		  experiments and simulation and observation of terrestrial
		  atmospheric mixing. In particular, the normalized
		  entrainment rate E=uE/sigmaH is well described by a
		  power-law dependence on the bulk Richardson number
		  RiB=DeltabL/sigma2H for the conditions studied,
		  20<~RiB<~420. We find E=ARi-nB, with best-fit values

		  different model supernova explosions are calculated. In
		  each case nucleosynthesis has already been determined for
		  200 isotopes in each of 600 to 1200 zones of the
		  presupernova star, including the effects of time dependent
		  convection. Here each star is exploded using a piston to
		  give a specified final kinetic energy at infinity
		  (typically 1.2 × 1051 ergs), and the explosive
		  modifications to the nucleosynthesis, including the effects
		  of neutrino irradiation, determined. A single value of the
		  critical 12C(alpha,gamma) 16O reaction rate corresponding
		  to 8(300 keV) = 170 keV barns is used in all calculations.
		  The synthesis of each isotope is discussed along with its

		  mass of the collapsed remnant is also determined and often
		  found not to correspond to the location of the piston
		  (typically the edge of the iron core), but to a "mass cut"
		  farther out. This mass cut is sensitive not only to the
		  explosion energy, but also to the presupernova structure,
		  stellar mass, and the metallicity. Unless the explosion
		  mechanism, for unknown reasons, provides a much larger
		  characteristic energy in more massive stars, it appears
		  likely that stars larger than about 30 Msun will experience
		  considerable reimplosion of heavy elements following the
		  initial launch of a successful shock. While such explosions
		  will produce a viable, bright Type II supernova light
		  curve, lacking perhaps the radioactive tail, they will have
		  dramatically reduced yields of heavy elements and may leave
		  black hole remnants of up to 10 and more solar masses. The
		  production of black holes may be particularly favored for

		  strong dynamical interactions between shells are seen in
		  2D. Although instigated by turbulence, the dynamic behavior
		  proceeds to sufficiently large amplitudes that it couples
		  to the nuclear burning. Dramatic growth of low-order modes

  Abstract	= {We consider the long-term evolution of debris following
		  the tidal disruption of compact stars in the context of
		  short gamma ray bursts. The initial encounter impulsively
		  creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of
		  powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find
		  that powerful winds are launched from the surface of the
		  disk, driven by the recombination of free nucleons into
		  alpha-particles. The associated energy release depletes the
		  mass supply and eventually shuts off activity of the
		  central engine. As a result, the luminosity and mass
		  accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar
		  behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient
		  cooling. This then enables a secondary episode of delayed
		  activity to become prominent as an observable signature,
		  when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial
		  encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object.
		  The timescale of the new accretion event can reach tens of

		  that the peak distribution of Ye in the ejecta is shifted
		  from ~0.15 to ~0.17 and broadened toward higher Ye due to
		  neutrino absorption. Nevertheless, in both cases, the
		  second and third peaks of the solar r-process element
		  distribution can be reproduced well. The rare progenitor
		  configuration that was used here, characterized by a high
		  rotation rate and a large magnetic field necessary for the
		  formation of bipolar jets, could naturally provide a site
		  for the strong r-process in agreement with observations of

		  employs radial-gauge, polar-slicing coordinates in which
		  the 3+1 equations simplify substantially. We discretize the

		  An approximate deleptonization scheme for the collapse

  Abstract	= {Context: Possible effects of magnetic fields in core
		  collapse supernovae rely on an efficient amplification of
		  the weak pre-collapse fields. It has been suggested that
		  the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) leads to a rapid
		  growth for these weak seed fields. Although plenty of MRI
		  studies exist for accretion disks, the application of their
		  results to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the
		  physics of supernova cores is substantially different from
		  that of accretion discs. Aims: We address the problem of
		  growth and saturation of the MRI in core collapse
		  supernovae by studying its evolution by means of
		  semi-global simulations, which combine elements of global
		  and local simulations by taking the presence of global
		  background gradients into account and using a local
		  computational grid. We investigate, in particular, the
		  termination of the growth of the MRI and the properties of
		  the turbulence in the saturated state. Methods: We analyze
		  the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify different
		  regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented
		  by semi-global ideal MHD simulations, where we consider
		  core matter in a local computational box (size ˜ 1 km)
		  rotating at sub-Keplerian velocity and where we allow for
		  the presence of a radial entropy gradient, but neglect
		  neutrino radiation. Results: We identify six regimes of the
		  MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and angular
		  velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the
		  instability criteria and growth rates for all regimes
		  relevant to core-collapse supernovae. The MRI grows
		  exponentially on time scales of milliseconds, the flow and
		  magnetic field geometries being dominated by channel flows.
		  We find MHD turbulence and efficient transport of angular
		  momentum. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are
		  disrupted by resistive instabilities (stemming from to the
		  finite conductivity of the numerical code), and MHD
		  turbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of
		  the resistive instabilities, we deduce scaling laws for the
		  termination amplitude of the MRI, which agree well with our
		  numerical models. We determine the dependence of the
		  development of large-scale coherent flow structures in the
		  saturated state on the aspect ratio of the simulation
		  boxes. Conclusions: The MRI can grow rapidly under the
		  conditions considered here, i.e., a rapidly rotating core
		  in hydrostatic equilibrium, possibly endowed with a
		  nonvanishing entropy gradient, leading to fields exceeding
		  1015~G. More investigations are required to cover the
		  parameter space more comprehensively and to include more
		  physical effects.},

  Abstract	= {We perform axisymmetric (2D) multiangle, multigroup

		  long-term postbounce evolution of the cores of one

		  neutrino transport. We find that 2D multiangle transport is
		  superior in capturing the global and local radiation-field
		  variations associated with rotation-induced and
		  SASI-induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations. In the
		  rotating model, multiangle transport predicts much larger
		  asymptotic neutrino flux asymmetries with pole-to-equator
		  ratios of up to ~2.5, while MGFLD tends to sphericize the

		  postshock regions. Along the poles, the multiangle
		  calculation predicts a dramatic enhancement of the neutrino
		  heating by up to a factor of 3, which alters the postbounce
		  evolution and results in greater polar shock radii and an
		  earlier onset of the initially rotationally weakened SASI.
		  In the nonrotating model, differences between multiangle
		  and MGFLD calculations remain small at early times when the
		  postshock region does not depart significantly from
		  spherical symmetry. At later times, however, the growing
		  SASI leads to large-scale asymmetries and the multiangle

  Abstract	= {We present results from an extensive set of one- and
		  two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the
		  supernova core-collapse, bounce, and postbounce phases and
		  focus on the proto-neutron star (PNS) spin periods and
		  rotational profiles as a function of initial iron core
		  angular velocity, degree of differential rotation, and
		  progenitor mass. For the models considered, we find a
		  roughly linear mapping between initial iron core rotation
		  rate and PNS spin. The results indicate that the magnitude
		  of the precollapse iron core angular velocities is the
		  single most important factor in determining the PNS spin.
		  Differences in progenitor mass and degree of differential
		  rotation lead only to small variations in the PNS
		  rotational period and profile. Based on our calculated PNS
		  spins at ~200-300 ms after bounce and assuming angular
		  momentum conservation, we estimate final neutron star
		  rotation periods. We find periods of 1 ms and shorter for

		  appreciably shorter than what previous studies have

		  conclude that there is no mechanism that can robustly spin
		  down a neutron star from ~1 ms periods to the ``injection''

  Abstract	= {We construct models of core-collapse supernovae in one
		  spatial dimension, including rotation, angular momentum
		  transport, and viscous dissipation employing an
		  alpha-prescription. We compare the evolution of a fiducial
		  11 Msolar nonrotating progenitor with its evolution when
		  including a wide range of imposed initial rotation profiles
		  (1.25s<P0<8 s, where P0 is the initial, approximately
		  solid-body, rotation period of the iron core). This range
		  of P0 covers the region of parameter space from where
		  rotation begins to modify the dynamics (P0~8 s) to where
		  angular velocities at collapse approach Keplerian (P0~1 s).
		  Under the assumption of strict angular momentum
		  conservation, all models in this range leave behind neutron
		  stars with spin periods <~10 ms, shorter than those of most
		  radio pulsars but similar to those expected theoretically
		  for magnetars at birth. A fraction of the gravitational
		  binding energy of collapse is stored in the free energy of
		  differential rotation. This energy source may be tapped by
		  viscous processes, providing a mechanism for energy
		  deposition that is not strongly coupled to the mass
		  accretion rate through the stalled supernova shock. This

  Abstract	= {We investigate the action of the magnetorotational
		  instability (MRI) in the context of iron-core collapse.
		  Exponential growth of the field on the timescale Omega-1 by
		  the MRI will dominate the linear growth process of
		  field-line ``wrapping'' with the same characteristic time.
		  We examine a variety of initial rotation states, with
		  solid-body rotation or a gradient in rotational velocity,
		  that correspond to models in the literature. A relatively
		  modest value of the initial rotation, a period of ~10 s,
		  will give a very rapidly rotating proto-neutron star and
		  hence strong differential rotation with respect to the
		  infalling matter. We assume conservation of angular
		  momentum on spherical shells. Rotational distortion and the
		  dynamic feedback of the magnetic field are neglected in the
		  subsequent calculation of rotational velocities. In our
		  rotating and collapsing conditions, a seed field is
		  expected to be amplified by the MRI and to grow
		  exponentially to a saturation field. Results are discussed
		  for two examples of saturation fields, a fiducial field
		  that corresponds to vA=rOmega and a field that corresponds
		  to the maximum growing mode of the MRI. We find, as
		  expected, that the shear is strong at the boundary of the
		  newly formed proto-neutron star and, unexpectedly, that the
		  region within the stalled shock can be subject to strong
		  MHD activity. Modest initial rotation velocities of the
		  iron core result in sub-Keplerian rotation and a
		  sub-equipartition magnetic field that nevertheless produce
		  substantial MHD luminosity and hoop stresses: saturation
		  fields of order 1015-1016 G can develop ~300 ms after
		  bounce with an associated MHD luminosity of ~1052 ergs s-1.
		  Bipolar flows driven by this MHD power can affect or even

  Abstract	= {We present here the first 2D rotating, multigroup,
		  radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of

		  effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and
		  propagation of MHD jets. We find that a quasi-steady state
		  can be quickly established after bounce, during which a
		  well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping
		  of power from the differentially rotating core. If the
		  initial spin period of the progenitor core is <~2 s, the
		  free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving
		  proto-neutron star is adequate to power a supernova
		  explosion and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are
		  well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop
		  stresses and maintain a small opening angle. We see
		  evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet
		  stream. Neutrino heating is subdominant in the rapidly
		  rotating models we explore but can contribute 10%-25% to
		  the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that

  Abstract	= {Strong toroidal magnetic fields generated in stellar
		  collapse can generate magnetocentrifugal jets in analogy to
		  those found in simulations of black hole accretion.
		  Magnetocentrifugal jets may explain why all core collapse
		  supernovae are found to be substantially asymmetric and
		  predominantly bipolar. We describe two phases: the initial
		  LeBlanc-Wilson jet and a subsequent protopulsar or toroidal
		  jet that propagates at about the core escape velocity. The
		  prompt LeBlanc-Wilson jets will produce an excess of
		  neutron-rich matter and hence cannot be the common origin
		  of supernova explosions; similar but less severe problems
		  arise with the protopulsar jet that may be alleviated by
		  partial evacuation along the axis by rotation. The jets
		  will produce bow shocks that tend to expel matter,
		  including iron and silicon, into equatorial tori. This may
		  help to account for observations of the element
		  distribution in Cas A. A magnetic ``switch'' mechanism may
		  apply in rare instances (when there is low density and
		  large magnetic field), with subsequent increase in the
		  speed and collimation of the toroidal jet. The conditions
		  that turn the magnetic switch ``on'' would yield a jet that
		  propagates rapidly and with small opening angle through the
		  star, depositing relatively little momentum. The result
		  could be enough infall to form a black hole. A third,
		  highly relativistic jet from the rotating black hole could
		  catch up to the protopulsar jet after it has emerged from
		  the star. The interaction of these two jets plausibly could
		  be the origin of the internal shocks thought to produce
		  gamma-ray bursts and could explain the presence of iron
		  lines in the afterglow. Recent estimates that typical
		  gamma-ray burst energy is ~3×1050 ergs imply either a very
		  low efficiency for conversion of rotation into jets by the
		  Blandford-Znajek mechanism or a rather rapid turnoff of the
		  jet process even though the black hole still rotates
		  rapidly. Magnetars and ``hypernovae'' might arise in an
		  intermediate parameter regime of energetic jets that yield
		  larger magnetic fields and provide more energy than the
		  routine case, but that are not so tightly collimated that
		  they yield failed supernova.},

  Abstract	= {As a massive star evolves through multiple stages of
		  nuclear burning on its way to becoming a supernova, a
		  complex, differentially rotating structure is set up.
		  Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic
		  instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields
		  generated by the differential rotation. We present the
		  first stellar evolution calculations to follow the
		  evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least
		  approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic,
		  from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of
		  iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the
		  magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a
		  range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we
		  find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate
		  of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when
		  compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular
		  momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to
		  become a neutron star is an increasing function of
		  main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more
		  massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more
		  important role in the star's explosion. The final angular
		  momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor
		  of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the
		  lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar
		  periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is
		  easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms
		  for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially
		  by fallback, are explored.},

  Abstract	= {One- and two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the
		  neutrino-driven supernova explosion of a 15 M&sun; star are
		  performed for the phase between stagnation of the prompt
		  shock and 1 s after core bounce. Variation of the neutrino
		  ( nu ) fluxes from the nu sphere shows that explosion
		  energy and timescale, initial proto--neutron star mass, and
		  explosive nucleosynthesis of Fe group elements depend
		  sensitively on the strength of the nu heating during the
		  first few 100 ms after shock formation. Convective overturn
		  in the nu -heated region behind the shock is a crucial help
		  for the explosion only in a narrow window of nu
		  luminosities. Here powerful explosions can be obtained only
		  in the multidimensional case, primarily because the
		  overturn increases the efficiency of nu energy deposition
		  by allowing cool postshock matter to penetrate inward to
		  the region of strongest heating, while heated gas can
		  quickly rise outward, thus reducing its energy loss due to
		  reemission of neutrinos. This interpretation is supported
		  by the different increase of the explosion energy with time
		  in one- and two-dimensional models. For higher core nu
		  fluxes spherically symmetrical models also yield energetic
		  explosions, while for lower luminosities even with
		  convection, no strong explosions occur. Cool gas in
		  downflows from the shock to the heating zone loses leptons
		  by nu e emission but gains energy by interactions with the
		  core nu fluxes. However, because it does not get very n
		  rich and its entropy increases, it is not accreted into the
		  low-entropy, neutronized surface of the neutron star.
		  Because of the absence of significant accretion while the
		  explosions develop on a timescale of a few 100 ms, the
		  initial proto--neutron star (baryonic) masses are only ~1.2
		  M&sun;. Turbulent activity around the neutron star is
		  transient; at 200--300 ms after shock formation, the
		  turbulent layer decouples from the nu -heated zone and
		  moves outward behind the supernova shock. The shock shows
		  deformation on large scales. Inhomogeneities of temperature
		  T, density rho , and velocity with contrasts of order unity
		  on scales of 30 deg--45 deg in the shell behind the shock
		  could help to explain anisotropies and radial mixing
		  observed in SN 1987A. When the supernova shock reaches the
		  entropy step of the Si-O interface at 5700 km about
		  400--500 ms after bounce, the rho inversion between the
		  dense shell and the low-density, "hot bubble" region around
		  the neutron star begins to steepen into a strong reverse
		  shock that forms a sharp discontinuity in the nu -driven
		  wind from the nascent neutron star. The deceleration of the
		  wind expansion might trigger significant, anisotropic
		  fallback of matter to the neutron star on a timescale of
		  several seconds.},

  Abstract	= {Asteroseismology of 1.0-2.0 M &sun; red giants by the
		  Kepler satellite has enabled the first definitive
		  measurements of interior rotation in both first ascent red
		  giant branch (RGB) stars and those on the helium burning
		  clump. The inferred rotation rates are 10-30 days for the
		  ≈0.2 M &sun; He degenerate cores on the RGB and 30-100
		  days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the
		  Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we
		  calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low
		  mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the
		  cooling white dwarf (WD) stage. We include transport of
		  angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities
		  and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative
		  zones (generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo). We find that
		  all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as
		  observed on the RGB and during core He burning, implying
		  that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must
		  be operating on the early RGB of low mass stars. Later
		  evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the
		  cooling WD phase appears to be at nearly constant core
		  angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic
		  pulsation code, ADIPLS, to explicitly highlight this
		  shortfall when applied to a specific Kepler asteroseismic
		  target, KIC8366239.},

  Abstract	= {We outline the possible physical processes, associated
		  timescales, and energetics that could lead to the
		  production of pulsars, jets, asymmetric supernovae, and
		  weak gamma-ray bursts in routine circumstances and to a
		  1016 G magnetar and perhaps stronger gamma-ray burst in
		  more extreme circumstances in the collapse of the bare core
		  of a massive star. The production of a LeBlanc-Wilson MHD
		  jet could provide an asymmetric supernova and result in a
		  weak gamma-ray burst when the jet accelerates down the
		  stellar density gradient of a hydrogen-poor photosphere.
		  The matter-dominated jet would be formed promptly but
		  requires 5-10 s to reach the surface of the progenitor of a
		  Type Ib/c supernova. During this time, the newly born
		  neutron star could contract, spin up, and wind up field
		  lines or turn on an alpha-Omega dynamo. In addition, the
		  light cylinder will contract from a radius large compared
		  to the Alfv{\'e}n radius to a size comparable to that of
		  the neutron star. This will disrupt the structure of any
		  organized dipole field and promote the generation of
		  ultrarelativistic MHD waves (UMHDW) at high density and
		  large-amplitude electromagnetic waves (LAEMW) at low
		  density. The generation of these waves would be delayed by
		  the cooling time of the neutron star ~=5-10 s, but the
		  propagation time is short so the UMHDW could arrive at the
		  surface at about the same time as the matter jet. In the
		  density gradient of the star and the matter jet, the
		  intense flux of UMHDW and LAEMW could drive shocks,
		  generate pions by proton-proton collision, or create
		  electron/positron pairs depending on the circumstances. The
		  UMHDW and LAEMW could influence the dynamics of the
		  explosion and might also tend to flow out the rotation axis
		  to produce a collimated gamma-ray burst.},

  Abstract	= {The neutrino-heated "gain layer" immediately behind the
		  stalled shock in a core-collapse supernova is unstable to
		  high-Reynolds-number turbulent convection. We carry out and
		  analyze a new set of 19 high-resolution three-dimensional
		  (3D) simulations with a three-species neutrino
		  leakage/heating scheme and compare with spherically
		  symmetric (one-dimensional, 1D) and axisymmetric

		  asphericity from convective burning in the Si/O shell, and

		  the gain layer and the susceptibility to explosion. 2D and
		  3D simulations explode at much lower neutrino heating rates
		  than 1D simulations. This is commonly explained by the fact
		  that nonradial dynamics allows accreting material to stay
		  longer in the gain layer. We show that this explanation is
		  incomplete. Our results indicate that the effective
		  turbulent ram pressure exerted on the shock plays a crucial
		  role by allowing multi-dimensional models to explode at a
		  lower postshock thermal pressure and thus with less
		  neutrino heating than 1D models. We connect the turbulent
		  ram pressure with turbulent energy at large scales and in

  Abstract	= {Since core-collapse supernova simulations still struggle
		  to produce robust neutrino-driven explosions in 3D, it has
		  been proposed that asphericities caused by convection in
		  the progenitor might facilitate shock revival by boosting
		  the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities in
		  the post-shock region. We investigate this scenario in
		  depth using 42 relativistic 2D simulations with multigroup
		  neutrino transport to examine the effects of velocity and
		  density perturbations in the progenitor for different
		  perturbation geometries that obey fundamental physical
		  constraints (like the anelastic condition). As a framework
		  for analysing our results, we introduce semi-empirical
		  scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent
		  velocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in
		  the saturation limit of non-radial instabilities. The
		  squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma2>, reflects the violence
		  of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive
		  runaway occurs for <Ma2> ≳ 0.3, corresponding to a
		  reduction of the critical neutrino luminosity by ˜ 25 per
		  cent compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,
		  progenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by
		  creating anisotropic mass flux on to the shock:
		  differential infall efficiently converts velocity
		  perturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations
		  deltarho/rho at the shock of the order of the initial
		  convective Mach number Maprog. The anisotropic mass flux
		  and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify
		  post-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l = 2, l = 1) modes
		  prove most conducive to shock revival, whereas small-scale
		  perturbations require unrealistically high convective Mach
		  numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor
		  are only of the order of Ma_prog^2 and therefore play a
		  subdominant role.},

  Abstract	= {We present new two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric neutrino
		  radiation/hydrodynamic models of core-collapse supernova
		  (CCSN) cores. We use the CASTRO code, which incorporates
		  truly multi-dimensional, multi-group, flux-limited
		  diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all
		  relevant {O}(v/c) terms. Our main motivation for carrying
		  out this study is to compare with recent 2D models produced
		  by other groups who have obtained explosions for some
		  progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN results that did
		  not incorporate {O}(v/c) terms. We follow the evolution of
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately
		  600 ms after bounce and do not obtain an explosion in any
		  of these models. Though the reason for the qualitative
		  disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
		  remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying
		  "ray-by-ray" approach employed by all other groups may be
		  compromising their results. We show that "ray-by-ray"
		  calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
		  variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are
		  better captured by our multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On
		  the other hand, our 2D models also make approximations,
		  making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
		  concerning the root of the differences between groups. We
		  discuss some of the diagnostics often employed in the
		  analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
		  relationship between the various explosion conditions that
		  have been proposed. Finally, we explore the ingredients
		  that may be missing in current calculations that may be
		  important in reproducing the properties of the average
		  CCSNe, should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the
