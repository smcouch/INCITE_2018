  Abstract	= {We study the impact of large-scale perturbations from
		  convective shell burning on the core-collapse supernova
		  explosion mechanism using 3D multigroup neutrino
		  hydrodynamics simulations of an 18M&sun; progenitor. Seed
		  asphericities in the O shell, obtained from a recent 3D
		  model of O shell burning, help trigger a neutrino-driven
		  explosion 330 ms after bounce whereas the shock is not
		  revived in a model based on a spherically symmetric
		  progenitor for at least another 300 ms. We tentatively
		  infer a reduction of the critical luminosity for shock
		  revival by ˜ 20 {per cent} due to pre-collapse
		  perturbations. This indicates that convective seed
		  perturbations play an important role in the explosion
		  mechanism in some progenitors. We follow the evolution of
		  the 18M&sun; model into the explosion phase for more than 2
		  s and find that the cycle of accretion and mass ejection is
		  still ongoing at this stage. With a preliminary value of
		  7.7 × 1050 erg for the diagnostic explosion energy, a
		  baryonic neutron star mass of 1.85M&sun;, a neutron star
		  kick of ˜ 600 km s^{-1} and a neutron star spin period of
		  ˜ 20 ms at the end of the simulation, the explosion and
		  remnant properties are slightly atypical, but still lie
		  comfortably within the observed distribution. Although more
		  refined simulations and a larger survey of progenitors are
		  still called for, this suggests that a solution to the
		  problem of shock revival and explosion energies in the
		  ballpark of observations is within reach for
		  neutrino-driven explosions in 3D.},

  Abstract	= {We investigate axisymmetric black hole (BH) formation and
		  its gravitational wave (GW) and neutrino signals with
		  self-consistent core-collapse supernova simulations of a
		  non-rotating 40 M &sun; progenitor star using the isotropic
		  diffusion source approximation for the neutrino transport
		  and a modified gravitational potential for general
		  relativistic effects. We consider four different neutron
		  star (NS) equations of state (EoS): LS220, SFHo,
		  BHBLambdavarphi, and DD2, and study the impact of the EoS
		  on BH formation dynamics and GW emission. We find that the
		  BH formation time is sensitive to the EoS from 460 to >1300
		  ms and is delayed in multiple dimensions for ~100--250 ms
		  due to the finite entropy effects. Depending on the EoS,
		  our simulations show the possibility that shock revival can
		  occur along with the collapse of the proto-neutron star
		  (PNS) to a BH. The gravitational waveforms contain four
		  major features that are similar to previous studies but
		  show extreme values: (1) a low-frequency signal (~300--500
		  Hz) from core-bounce and prompt convection, (2) a strong
		  signal from the PNS g-mode oscillation among other
		  features, (3) a high-frequency signal from the PNS
		  inner-core convection, and (4) signals from the standing
		  accretion shock instability and convection. The peak
		  frequency at the onset of BH formation reaches to ~2.3 kHz.
		  The characteristic amplitude of a 10 kpc object at peak
		  frequency is detectable but close to the noise threshold of
		  the Advanced LIGO and KAGRA, suggesting that the
		  next-generation GW detector will need to improve the
		  sensitivity at the kHz domain to better observe
		  stellar-mass BH formation from core-collapse supernovae or
		  failed supernovae.},

  Abstract	= {We present a systematic study of the pure deflagration
		  model of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using
		  three-dimensional, high-resolution, full-star
		  hydrodynamical simulations, nucleosynthetic yields
		  calculated using Lagrangian tracer particles, and light
		  curves calculated using radiation transport. We evaluate
		  the simulations by comparing their predicted light curves
		  with many observed SNe Ia using the SALT2 data-driven model
		  and find that the simulations may correspond to
		  under-luminous SNe Iax. We explore the effects of the
		  initial conditions on our results by varying the number of
		  randomly selected ignition points from 63 to 3500, and the
		  radius of the centered sphere they are confined in from 128
		  to 384 km. We find that the rate of nuclear burning depends
		  on the number of ignition points at early times, the
		  density of ignition points at intermediate times, and the
		  radius of the confining sphere at late times. The results
		  depend primarily on the number of ignition points, but we
		  do not expect this to be the case in general. The
		  simulations with few ignition points release more nuclear
		  energy E nuc, have larger kinetic energies E K, and produce
		  more 56Ni than those with many ignition points, and differ
		  in the distribution of 56Ni, Si, and C/O in the ejecta. For
		  these reasons, the simulations with few ignition points
		  exhibit higher peak B-band absolute magnitudes M B and
		  light curves that rise and decline more quickly; their M B
		  and light curves resemble those of under-luminous SNe Iax,
		  while those for simulations with many ignition points are

  Abstract	= {As a massive star evolves through multiple stages of
		  nuclear burning on its way to becoming a supernova, a
		  complex, differentially rotating structure is set up.
		  Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic
		  instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields
		  generated by the differential rotation. We present the
		  first stellar evolution calculations to follow the
		  evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least
		  approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic,
		  from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of
		  iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the
		  magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a
		  range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we
		  find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate
		  of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when
		  compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular
		  momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to
		  become a neutron star is an increasing function of
		  main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more
		  massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more
		  important role in the star's explosion. The final angular
		  momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor
		  of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the
		  lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar
		  periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is
		  easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms
		  for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially
		  by fallback, are explored.},

@Article{	  burrows:2007,
  Abstract	= {We present here the first 2D rotating, multigroup,
		  radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of
		  supernova core collapse, bounce, and explosion. In the
		  context of rapid rotation, we focus on the dynamical
		  effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and
		  propagation of MHD jets. We find that a quasi-steady state
		  can be quickly established after bounce, during which a
		  well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping
		  of power from the differentially rotating core. If the
		  initial spin period of the progenitor core is <~2 s, the
		  free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving
		  proto-neutron star is adequate to power a supernova
		  explosion and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are
		  well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop
		  stresses and maintain a small opening angle. We see
		  evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet
		  stream. Neutrino heating is subdominant in the rapidly
		  rotating models we explore but can contribute 10%-25% to
		  the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that
		  even in the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova
		  explosion might be followed by a secondary, weak MHD jet
		  explosion, which, because of its weakness, may to date have
		  gone unnoticed in supernova debris. Furthermore, we suggest
		  that the generation of a nonrelativistic MHD precursor jet
		  during the early proto-neutron star/supernova phase is
		  implicit in both the collapsar and ``millisecond magnetar''
		  models of GRBs. The multidimensional, multigroup, rapidly
		  rotating RMHD simulations we describe here are a start
		  along the path toward more realistic simulations of the
		  possible role of magnetic fields in some of nature's most
		  dramatic events.},

  Abstract	= {We investigate the action of the magnetorotational
		  instability (MRI) in the context of iron-core collapse.
		  Exponential growth of the field on the timescale Omega-1 by
		  the MRI will dominate the linear growth process of
		  field-line ``wrapping'' with the same characteristic time.
		  We examine a variety of initial rotation states, with
		  solid-body rotation or a gradient in rotational velocity,
		  that correspond to models in the literature. A relatively
		  modest value of the initial rotation, a period of ~10 s,
		  will give a very rapidly rotating proto-neutron star and
		  hence strong differential rotation with respect to the
		  infalling matter. We assume conservation of angular
		  momentum on spherical shells. Rotational distortion and the
		  dynamic feedback of the magnetic field are neglected in the
		  subsequent calculation of rotational velocities. In our
		  rotating and collapsing conditions, a seed field is
		  expected to be amplified by the MRI and to grow
		  exponentially to a saturation field. Results are discussed
		  for two examples of saturation fields, a fiducial field
		  that corresponds to vA=rOmega and a field that corresponds
		  to the maximum growing mode of the MRI. We find, as
		  expected, that the shear is strong at the boundary of the
		  newly formed proto-neutron star and, unexpectedly, that the
		  region within the stalled shock can be subject to strong
		  MHD activity. Modest initial rotation velocities of the
		  iron core result in sub-Keplerian rotation and a
		  sub-equipartition magnetic field that nevertheless produce
		  substantial MHD luminosity and hoop stresses: saturation
		  fields of order 1015-1016 G can develop ~300 ms after
		  bounce with an associated MHD luminosity of ~1052 ergs s-1.
		  Bipolar flows driven by this MHD power can affect or even
		  cause the explosions associated with core-collapse
		  supernovae.},

  Abstract	= {We present results of a systematic study of failing
		  core-collapse supernovae and the formation of stellar-mass
		  black holes (BHs). Using our open-source
		  general-relativistic 1.5D code GR1D equipped with a
		  three-species neutrino leakage/heating scheme and over 100
		  presupernova models, we study the effects of the choice of
		  nuclear equation of state (EOS), zero-age main sequence
		  (ZAMS) mass and metallicity, rotation, and mass-loss
		  prescription on BH formation. We find that the outcome, for
		  a given EOS, can be estimated, to first order, by a single
		  parameter, the compactness of the stellar core at bounce.
		  By comparing protoneutron star (PNS) structure at the onset
		  of gravitational instability with solutions of the
		  Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof equations, we find that thermal
		  pressure support in the outer PNS core is responsible for
		  raising the maximum PNS mass by up to 25% above the cold NS
		  value. By artificially increasing neutrino heating, we find
		  the critical neutrino heating efficiency required for
		  exploding a given progenitor structure and connect these
		  findings with ZAMS conditions, establishing, albeit
		  approximately, for the first time based on actual collapse
		  simulations, the mapping between ZAMS parameters and the
		  outcome of core collapse. We also study the effect of
		  progenitor rotation and find that the dimensionless spin of
		  nascent BHs may be robustly limited below a* = Jc/GM 2 = 1
		  by the appearance of nonaxisymmetric rotational
		  instabilities.},

  Abstract	= {Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is important in many
		  high-energy astrophysical systems, where instabilities can
		  amplify the local magnetic field over very short
		  timescales. Specifically, the magnetorotational instability
		  and dynamo action have been suggested as a mechanism for
		  the growth of magnetar-strength magnetic fields (of 1015
		  gauss and above) and for powering the explosion of a
		  rotating massive star. Such stars are candidate progenitors
		  of type Ic-bl hypernovae, which make up all supernovae that
		  are connected to long gamma-ray bursts. The
		  magnetorotational instability has been studied with local
		  high-resolution shearing-box simulations in three
		  dimensions, and with global two-dimensional simulations,
		  but it is not known whether turbulence driven by this
		  instability can result in the creation of a large-scale,
		  ordered and dynamically relevant field. Here we report
		  results from global, three-dimensional,
		  general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic turbulence
		  simulations. We show that hydromagnetic turbulence in
		  rapidly rotating protoneutron stars produces an inverse
		  cascade of energy. We find a large-scale, ordered toroidal
		  field that is consistent with the formation of bipolar
		  magnetorotationally driven outflows. Our results
		  demonstrate that rapidly rotating massive stars are
		  plausible progenitors for both type Ic-bl supernovae and
		  long gamma-ray bursts, and provide a viable mechanism for
		  the formation of magnetars. Moreover, our findings suggest
		  that rapidly rotating massive stars might lie behind
		  potentially magnetar-powered superluminous supernovae.},

  Abstract	= {On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of
		  the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
		  simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave
		  signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to
		  250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of 1.0
		  ×10-21. It matches the waveform predicted by general
		  relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black
		  holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole.
		  The signal was observed with a matched-filter
		  signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate
		  estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years,
		  equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 sigma . The
		  source lies at a luminosity distance of 41 0-180+160 Mpc
		  corresponding to a redshift z =0.0 9-0.04+0.03 . In the
		  source frame, the initial black hole masses are 3
		  6-4+5M&sun; and 2 9-4+4M&sun; , and the final black hole
		  mass is 6 2-4+4M&sun; , with 3. 0-0.5+0.5M&sun; c2 radiated
		  in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90%
		  credible intervals. These observations demonstrate the
		  existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This
		  is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and
		  the first observation of a binary black hole merger.},

  Abstract	= {We describe the observation of GW170104, a
		  gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of a
		  pair of stellar-mass black holes. The signal was measured
		  on January 4, 2017 at 10:11:58.6 UTC by the twin advanced
		  detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
		  Observatory during their second observing run, with a
		  network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a false alarm rate
		  less than 1 in 70 000 years. The inferred component black
		  hole masses are 31. 2-6.0+8.4M&sun; and 19. 4-5.9+5.3
		  M&sun; (at the 90% credible level). The black hole spins
		  are best constrained through measurement of the effective
		  inspiral spin parameter, a mass-weighted combination of the
		  spin components perpendicular to the orbital plane,
		  chieff=-0.1 2-0.30+0.21 . This result implies that spin
		  configurations with both component spins positively aligned
		  with the orbital angular momentum are disfavored. The
		  source luminosity distance is 88 0-390+450 Mpc
		  corresponding to a redshift of z =0.1 8-0.07+0.08 . We
		  constrain the magnitude of modifications to the
		  gravitational-wave dispersion relation and perform null
		  tests of general relativity. Assuming that gravitons are
		  dispersed in vacuum like massive particles, we bound the
		  graviton mass to mg<=7.7 ×10-23 eV /c2 . In all cases, we
		  find that GW170104 is consistent with general relativity.},
