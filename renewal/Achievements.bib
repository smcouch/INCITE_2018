  Abstract	= {The details of the physical mechanism that drives
		  core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) remain uncertain. While
		  there is an emerging consensus on the qualitative outcome
		  of detailed CCSN mechanism simulations in 2D, only recently
		  have high-fidelity 3D simulations become possible. Here we
		  present the results of an extensive set of 3D CCSN
		  simulations using high-fidelity multidimensional neutrino
		  transport, high-resolution hydrodynamics, and approximate
		  general relativistic gravity. We employ a state-of-the-art
		  20 solar mass progenitor generated using the Modules for
		  Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA; Farmer et al.
		  (2016) Paxton et al. (2011, 2013, 2015, 2018) and the SFHo
		  equation of state of Steiner et al. (2013). While none of
		  our 3D CCSN simulations explode within ~500ms after core
		  bounce, we find that the presence of large scale aspherical
		  motion in the Si and O shells surrounding the collapsing
		  iron core aid shock expansion and bring the models closer
		  to the threshold of explosion. We also find some dependence
		  on resolution and geometry (octant vs. full 4$\pi$). As has
		  been noted in other recent works, we find that the
		  post-shock turbulence plays an important role in
		  determining the overall dynamical evolution of our
		  simulations. We find a strong standing accretion shock
		  instability (SASI) that develops at late times during the
		  shock recession epoch. The SASI aids in transient shock
		  expansion phases, but is not enough to result in shock
		  revival. We also report that for a subset of our
		  simulations, we find conclusive evidence for the LESA first
		  reported in Tamborra et al. (2014), but until now, not
		  confirmed by other simulation codes. Both the progenitor
		  asphericities and the SASI-induced transient shock
		  expansion phases generate transient gravitational waves and
		  neutrino signal modulations via perturbations of the
		  protoneutron star by turbulent motions. (abridged)},

  Abstract	= {We study the impact of large-scale perturbations from
		  convective shell burning on the core-collapse supernova
		  explosion mechanism using 3D multigroup neutrino
		  hydrodynamics simulations of an 18M&sun; progenitor. Seed
		  asphericities in the O shell, obtained from a recent 3D
		  model of O shell burning, help trigger a neutrino-driven
		  explosion 330 ms after bounce whereas the shock is not
		  revived in a model based on a spherically symmetric
		  progenitor for at least another 300 ms. We tentatively
		  infer a reduction of the critical luminosity for shock
		  revival by ˜ 20 {per cent} due to pre-collapse
		  perturbations. This indicates that convective seed
		  perturbations play an important role in the explosion
		  mechanism in some progenitors. We follow the evolution of
		  the 18M&sun; model into the explosion phase for more than 2
		  s and find that the cycle of accretion and mass ejection is
		  still ongoing at this stage. With a preliminary value of
		  7.7 × 1050 erg for the diagnostic explosion energy, a
		  baryonic neutron star mass of 1.85M&sun;, a neutron star
		  kick of ˜ 600 km s^{-1} and a neutron star spin period of
		  ˜ 20 ms at the end of the simulation, the explosion and
		  remnant properties are slightly atypical, but still lie
		  comfortably within the observed distribution. Although more
		  refined simulations and a larger survey of progenitors are
		  still called for, this suggests that a solution to the
		  problem of shock revival and explosion energies in the
		  ballpark of observations is within reach for
		  neutrino-driven explosions in 3D.},

@Article{	  summa:2018,
  Abstract	= {We present the first self-consistent, 3D core-collapse
		  supernova simulations performed with the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX
		  code for a rotating progenitor star. Besides using the
		  angular momentum of the 15 M &sun; model as obtained in the
		  stellar evolution calculation with an angular frequency of
		  ~10-3 rad s-1 (spin period of more than 6000 s) at the
		  Si/Si--O interface, we also computed 2D and 3D cases with
		  no rotation and with a ~300 times shorter rotation period
		  and different angular resolutions. In 2D, only the
		  nonrotating and slowly rotating models explode, while rapid
		  rotation prevents an explosion within 500 ms after bounce
		  because of lower radiated neutrino luminosities and mean
		  energies and thus reduced neutrino heating. In contrast,
		  only the fast-rotating model develops an explosion in 3D
		  when the Si/Si--O interface collapses through the shock.
		  The explosion becomes possible by the support of a powerful
		  standing accretion shock instability spiral mode, which
		  compensates for the reduced neutrino heating and pushes
		  strong shock expansion in the equatorial plane. Fast
		  rotation in 3D leads to a ``two-dimensionalization'' of the
		  turbulent energy spectrum (yielding roughly a -3 instead of
		  a -5/3 power-law slope at intermediate wavelengths) with
		  enhanced kinetic energy on the largest spatial scales. We
		  also introduce a generalization of the ``universal critical
		  luminosity condition'' of Summa et al. to account for the
		  effects of rotation, and we demonstrate its viability for a
		  set of more than 40 core-collapse simulations, including 9
		  and 20 M &sun; progenitors, as well as black-hole-forming
		  cases of 40 and 75 M &sun; stars to be discussed in
		  forthcoming papers.},

  Abstract	= {We present results from simulations of core-collapse
		  supernovae in FLASH using a newly implemented
		  multidimensional neutrino transport scheme and a newly
		  implemented general relativistic (GR) treatment of gravity.
		  We use a two-moment method with an analytic closure
		  (so-called M1 transport) for the neutrino transport. This
		  transport is multienergy, multispecies, velocity dependent,
		  and truly multidimensional, i.e., we do not assume the
		  commonly used ``ray-by-ray'' approximation. Our GR gravity
		  is implemented in our Newtonian hydrodynamics simulations
		  via an effective relativistic potential that closely
		  reproduces the GR structure of neutron stars and has been
		  shown to match GR simulations of core collapse quite well.
		  In axisymmetry, we simulate core-collapse supernovae with
		  four different progenitor models in both Newtonian and GR
		  gravity. We find that the more compact proto--neutron star
		  structure realized in simulations with GR gravity gives
		  higher neutrino luminosities and higher neutrino energies.
		  These differences in turn give higher neutrino heating
		  rates (upward of ~20%--30% over the corresponding Newtonian
		  gravity simulations) that increase the efficacy of the
		  neutrino mechanism. Three of the four models successfully
		  explode in the simulations assuming GREP gravity. In our
		  Newtonian gravity simulations, two of the four models
		  explode, but at times much later than observed in our GR
		  gravity simulations. Our results, in both Newtonian and GR
		  gravity, compare well with several other studies in the
		  literature. These results conclusively show that the
		  approximation of Newtonian gravity for simulating the
		  core-collapse supernova central engine is not acceptable.
		  We also simulate four additional models in GR gravity to
		  highlight the growing disparity between parameterized 1D
		  models of core-collapse supernovae and the current
		  generation of 2D models.},

  Abstract	= {We present new two-dimensional (2D) axisymmetric neutrino
		  radiation/hydrodynamic models of core-collapse supernova
		  (CCSN) cores. We use the CASTRO code, which incorporates
		  truly multi-dimensional, multi-group, flux-limited
		  diffusion (MGFLD) neutrino transport, including all
		  relevant {O}(v/c) terms. Our main motivation for carrying
		  out this study is to compare with recent 2D models produced
		  by other groups who have obtained explosions for some
		  progenitor stars and with recent 2D VULCAN results that did
		  not incorporate {O}(v/c) terms. We follow the evolution of
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 solar-mass progenitors to approximately
		  600 ms after bounce and do not obtain an explosion in any
		  of these models. Though the reason for the qualitative
		  disagreement among the groups engaged in CCSN modeling
		  remains unclear, we speculate that the simplifying
		  "ray-by-ray" approach employed by all other groups may be
		  compromising their results. We show that "ray-by-ray"
		  calculations greatly exaggerate the angular and temporal
		  variations of the neutrino fluxes, which we argue are
		  better captured by our multi-dimensional MGFLD approach. On
		  the other hand, our 2D models also make approximations,
		  making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions
		  concerning the root of the differences between groups. We
		  discuss some of the diagnostics often employed in the
		  analyses of CCSN simulations and highlight the intimate
		  relationship between the various explosion conditions that
		  have been proposed. Finally, we explore the ingredients
		  that may be missing in current calculations that may be
		  important in reproducing the properties of the average
		  CCSNe, should the delayed neutrino-heating mechanism be the
		  correct mechanism of explosion.},

  Abstract	= {Since core-collapse supernova simulations still struggle
		  to produce robust neutrino-driven explosions in 3D, it has
		  been proposed that asphericities caused by convection in
		  the progenitor might facilitate shock revival by boosting
		  the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities in
		  the post-shock region. We investigate this scenario in
		  depth using 42 relativistic 2D simulations with multigroup
		  neutrino transport to examine the effects of velocity and
		  density perturbations in the progenitor for different
		  perturbation geometries that obey fundamental physical
		  constraints (like the anelastic condition). As a framework
		  for analysing our results, we introduce semi-empirical
		  scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent
		  velocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in
		  the saturation limit of non-radial instabilities. The
		  squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma2>, reflects the violence
		  of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive
		  runaway occurs for <Ma2> ≳ 0.3, corresponding to a
		  reduction of the critical neutrino luminosity by ˜ 25 per
		  cent compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,
		  progenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by
		  creating anisotropic mass flux on to the shock:
		  differential infall efficiently converts velocity
		  perturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations
		  deltarho/rho at the shock of the order of the initial
		  convective Mach number Maprog. The anisotropic mass flux
		  and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify
		  post-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l = 2, l = 1) modes
		  prove most conducive to shock revival, whereas small-scale
		  perturbations require unrealistically high convective Mach
		  numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor
		  are only of the order of Ma_prog^2 and therefore play a
		  subdominant role.},

  Abstract	= {The neutrino-heated "gain layer" immediately behind the
		  stalled shock in a core-collapse supernova is unstable to
		  high-Reynolds-number turbulent convection. We carry out and
		  analyze a new set of 19 high-resolution three-dimensional
		  (3D) simulations with a three-species neutrino
		  leakage/heating scheme and compare with spherically
		  symmetric (one-dimensional, 1D) and axisymmetric
		  (two-dimensional, 2D) simulations carried out with the same
		  methods. We study the postbounce supernova evolution in a
		  15 M &sun; progenitor star and vary the local neutrino
		  heating rate, the magnitude and spatial dependence of
		  asphericity from convective burning in the Si/O shell, and
		  spatial resolution. Our simulations suggest that there is a
		  direct correlation between the strength of turbulence in
		  the gain layer and the susceptibility to explosion. 2D and
		  3D simulations explode at much lower neutrino heating rates
		  than 1D simulations. This is commonly explained by the fact
		  that nonradial dynamics allows accreting material to stay
		  longer in the gain layer. We show that this explanation is
		  incomplete. Our results indicate that the effective
		  turbulent ram pressure exerted on the shock plays a crucial
		  role by allowing multi-dimensional models to explode at a
		  lower postshock thermal pressure and thus with less
		  neutrino heating than 1D models. We connect the turbulent
		  ram pressure with turbulent energy at large scales and in
		  this way explain why 2D simulations are erroneously
		  exploding more easily than 3D simulations.},

  Abstract	= {The timescale of deleptonization by neutrino loss and
		  associated contraction of a proto-neutron star is short
		  compared to the time it takes to propagate a shock through
		  the helium core of a massive star, and so the
		  deleptonization phase does not occur in the vacuum of
		  space, but within the supernova ambiance, whether or not
		  there has been a successful explosion. Dynamical
		  nonaxisymmetric instabilities (NAXI) are predicted for
		  sufficiently strongly differentially rotating proto-neutron
		  stars. Some modes are unstable for small values of the
		  ratio of rotational kinetic energy to binding energy,
		  T/W>~0.01. The NAXI are likely to drive magnetoacoustic
		  waves into the surrounding time-dependent density
		  structure. These waves represent a mechanism of the
		  dissipation of the free energy of differential rotation of
		  the proto-neutron star, and the outward deposition of this
		  energy may play a role in the supernova explosion process.
		  We estimate the power produced by this process and the
		  associated timescale and discuss the possible systematics
		  of the deleptonization phase in this context. A likely
		  possibility is that the proto-neutron star will spin down
		  through these effects before deleptonization and produce
		  substantial but not excessive energy input.},

  Abstract	= {A three-dimensional, Newtonian hydrodynamic technique is
		  used to follow the postbounce phase of a stellar core
		  collapse event. For realistic initial data, we have
		  employed post-core-bounce snapshots of the iron core of a
		  20 Msolar star. The models exhibit strong differential
		  rotation but have centrally condensed density
		  stratifications. We demonstrate for the first time that
		  such postbounce cores are subject to a so-called low-T/|W|
		  nonaxisymmetric instability and, in particular, can become
		  dynamically unstable to an (m=1)-dominated spiral mode at
		  T/|W| ~0.08. We calculate the gravitational wave (GW)
		  emission by the instability and find that the emitted waves
		  may be detectable by current and future GW observatories
		  from anywhere in the Milky Way.},

  Abstract	= {We study the dependence of the delayed neutrino-heating
		  mechanism for core-collapse supernovae on the equation of
		  state (EOS). Using a simplified treatment of the neutrino
		  physics with a parameterized neutrino luminosity, we
		  explore the relationship between explosion time, mass
		  accretion rate, and neutrino luminosity for a 15 M &sun;
		  progenitor in 1D and 2D. We test the EOS most commonly used
		  in core-collapse simulations: the models of Lattimer &
		  Swesty and the model of Shen et al. We find that for a
		  given neutrino luminosity, "stiffer" EOS, where stiffness
		  is determined by a combination of nuclear matter properties
		  not just incompressibility, K, explode later than "softer"
		  EOS. The EOS of Shen et al., being the stiffest EOS, by
		  virtue of larger incompressibility and symmetry energy
		  slope, L, explodes later than any of the Lattimer & Swesty
		  EOS models. Amongst the Lattimer & Swesty EOS that all
		  share the same value of L, the explosion time increases
		  with increasing nuclear incompressibility, K. We find that
		  this holds in both 1D and 2D, while for all of the models,
		  explosions are obtained more easily in 2D than in 1D. We
		  argue that this EOS dependence is due in part to a greater
		  amount of acoustic flux from denser proto-neutron star
		  atmospheres that result from a softer EOS. We also discuss
		  the relevance of approximate instability criteria to
		  realistic simulations.},

  Abstract	= {As a massive star evolves through multiple stages of

		  Angular momentum is transported by a variety of classic
		  instabilities and also by magnetic torques from fields
		  generated by the differential rotation. We present the
		  first stellar evolution calculations to follow the
		  evolution of rotating massive stars including, at least
		  approximately, all these effects, magnetic and nonmagnetic,
		  from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of
		  iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the
		  magnetic fields is as described by Spruit in 2002, and a
		  range of uncertain parameters is explored. In general, we
		  find that magnetic torques decrease the final rotation rate
		  of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50 when
		  compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular
		  momentum in that part of the presupernova star destined to
		  become a neutron star is an increasing function of
		  main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived from more
		  massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more
		  important role in the star's explosion. The final angular
		  momentum of the core has been determined-to within a factor
		  of 2-by the time the star ignites carbon burning. For the
		  lighter stars studied, around 15 Msolar, we predict pulsar
		  periods at birth near 15 ms, though a factor of 2 range is
		  easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several mechanisms
		  for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially
		  by fallback, are explored.},

  Abstract	= {We present here the first 2D rotating, multigroup,
		  radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of
		  supernova core collapse, bounce, and explosion. In the
		  context of rapid rotation, we focus on the dynamical
		  effects of magnetic stresses and the creation and
		  propagation of MHD jets. We find that a quasi-steady state
		  can be quickly established after bounce, during which a
		  well-collimated MHD jet is maintained by continuous pumping
		  of power from the differentially rotating core. If the
		  initial spin period of the progenitor core is <~2 s, the
		  free energy reservoir in the secularly evolving
		  proto-neutron star is adequate to power a supernova
		  explosion and may be enough for a hypernova. The jets are
		  well collimated by the infalling material and magnetic hoop
		  stresses and maintain a small opening angle. We see
		  evidence of sausage instabilities in the emerging jet
		  stream. Neutrino heating is subdominant in the rapidly
		  rotating models we explore but can contribute 10%-25% to
		  the final explosion energy. Our simulations suggest that
		  even in the case of modest or slow rotation, a supernova
		  explosion might be followed by a secondary, weak MHD jet
		  explosion, which, because of its weakness, may to date have
		  gone unnoticed in supernova debris. Furthermore, we suggest
		  that the generation of a nonrelativistic MHD precursor jet
		  during the early proto-neutron star/supernova phase is
		  implicit in both the collapsar and ``millisecond magnetar''
		  models of GRBs. The multidimensional, multigroup, rapidly
		  rotating RMHD simulations we describe here are a start
		  along the path toward more realistic simulations of the
		  possible role of magnetic fields in some of nature's most
		  dramatic events.},

  Abstract	= {We perform axisymmetric (2D) multiangle, multigroup
		  neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic calculations of the
		  postbounce phase of core-collapse supernovae using a
		  genuinely 2D discrete-ordinate (Sn) method. We follow the
		  long-term postbounce evolution of the cores of one
		  nonrotating and one rapidly rotating 20 M&sun; stellar
		  model for ~400 milliseconds from 160 to ~550 ms after
		  bounce. We present a multidimensional analysis of the
		  multiangle neutrino radiation fields and compare in detail
		  with counterpart simulations carried out in the 2D
		  multigroup flux-limited diffusion (MGFLD) approximation to
		  neutrino transport. We find that 2D multiangle transport is
		  superior in capturing the global and local radiation-field
		  variations associated with rotation-induced and
		  SASI-induced aspherical hydrodynamic configurations. In the
		  rotating model, multiangle transport predicts much larger
		  asymptotic neutrino flux asymmetries with pole-to-equator
		  ratios of up to ~2.5, while MGFLD tends to sphericize the
		  radiation fields already in the optically semitransparent
		  postshock regions. Along the poles, the multiangle
		  calculation predicts a dramatic enhancement of the neutrino
		  heating by up to a factor of 3, which alters the postbounce
		  evolution and results in greater polar shock radii and an
		  earlier onset of the initially rotationally weakened SASI.
		  In the nonrotating model, differences between multiangle
		  and MGFLD calculations remain small at early times when the
		  postshock region does not depart significantly from
		  spherical symmetry. At later times, however, the growing
		  SASI leads to large-scale asymmetries and the multiangle
		  calculation predicts up to 30% higher average integral
		  neutrino energy deposition rates than MGFLD.},

  Abstract	= {We consider the long-term evolution of debris following
		  the tidal disruption of compact stars in the context of
		  short gamma ray bursts. The initial encounter impulsively
		  creates a hot, dense, neutrino-cooled disk capable of
		  powering the prompt emission. After a long delay, we find
		  that powerful winds are launched from the surface of the
		  disk, driven by the recombination of free nucleons into
		  alpha-particles. The associated energy release depletes the
		  mass supply and eventually shuts off activity of the
		  central engine. As a result, the luminosity and mass
		  accretion rate deviate from the earlier self-similar
		  behavior expected for an isolated ring with efficient
		  cooling. This then enables a secondary episode of delayed
		  activity to become prominent as an observable signature,
		  when material in the tidal tails produced by the initial
		  encounter returns to the vicinity of the central object.
		  The timescale of the new accretion event can reach tens of
		  seconds to minutes, depending on the details of the system.
		  The associated energies and timescales are consistent with
		  those occurring in X-ray flares.},

  Abstract	= {Magnetic fields can be created in stably stratified
		  (non-convective) layers in a differentially rotating star.
		  A magnetic instability in the toroidal field (wound up by
		  differential rotation) replaces the role of convection in
		  closing the field amplification loop. Tayler instability is
		  likely to be the most relevant magnetic instability. A
		  dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and
		  applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in
		  stellar interiors. It produces a predominantly horizontal
		  field. This dynamo process is found to be more effective in
		  transporting angular momentum than the known hydrodynamic
		  mechanisms. It might account for the observed pattern of
		  rotation in the solar core.},

  Abstract	= {Three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations of shell
		  oxygen burning exhibit bursty, recurrent fluctuations in
		  turbulent kinetic energy. These are shown to be due to a
		  general instability of the convective cell, requiring only
		  a localized source of heating or cooling. Such fluctuations
		  are shown to be suppressed in simulations of stellar
		  evolution which use the mixing-length theory.
		  Quantitatively similar behavior occurs in the model of a
		  convective roll (cell) of Lorenz, which is known to have a
		  strange attractor that gives rise to chaotic fluctuations
		  in time of velocity and, as we show, luminosity. Study of
		  simulations suggests that the behavior of a Lorenz
		  convective roll may resemble that of a cell in convective
		  flow. We examine some implications of this simplest
		  approximation and suggest paths for improvement. Using the
		  Lorenz model as representative of a convective cell, a
		  multiple-cell model of a convective layer gives total
		  luminosity fluctuations which are suggestive of irregular
		  variables (red giants and supergiants), and of the long
		  secondary period feature in semiregular asymptotic giant
		  branch variables. This "tau-mechanism" is a new source for
		  stellar variability, which is inherently nonlinear (unseen
		  in linear stability analysis), and one closely related to
		  intermittency in turbulence. It was already implicit in the
		  3D global simulations of Woodward et al. This fluctuating
		  behavior is seen in extended two-dimensional simulations of
		  CNeOSi burning shells, and may cause instability which
		  leads to eruptions in progenitors of core-collapse
		  supernovae prior to collapse.},

  Abstract	= {Stellar physics and evolution calculations enable a broad
		  range of research in astrophysics. Modules for Experiments
		  in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source,
		  robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range
		  of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A
		  one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar,
		  combines many of the numerical and physics modules for
		  simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios
		  ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including
		  advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully
		  coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously.
		  It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep
		  controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on
		  OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state,
		  opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data,
		  and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is
		  constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own
		  explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
		  independent development. Several detailed examples indicate
		  the extensive verification and testing that is continuously
		  performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities
		  that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary
		  tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant
		  planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track
		  of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a
		  cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the
		  evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core
		  burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning
		  asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of
		  slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete
		  evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the
		  onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing
		  Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion
		  onto a neutron star. MESA can be downloaded from the
		  project Web site (http://mesa.sourceforge.net/).},

  Abstract	= {We substantially update the capabilities of the open
		  source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar
		  Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar
		  evolution module, MESA star. Improvements in MESA star's
		  ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends
		  its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that
		  of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology
		  enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions
		  motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic
		  pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a
		  numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more
		  easily implemented when many nuclei are present at
		  non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which
		  MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
		  mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M &sun; stars
		  through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal
		  pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We
		  implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical
		  abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star
		  models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
		  introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes
		  that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to
		  core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of
		  supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability
		  progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which
		  MESA star solves the fully coupled stellar structure and
		  composition equations, and we show how this has improved
		  the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core
		  processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state,
		  opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary
		  conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software
		  Development Kit that packages all the required components
		  needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated
		  build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools
		  developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESA

  Abstract	= {The relevance of the standing accretion shock instability
		  (SASI) compared to neutrino-driven convection in
		  three-dimensional (3D) supernova-core environments is still
		  highly controversial. Studying a 27 M &sun; progenitor, we
		  demonstrate, for the first time, that violent SASI activity
		  can develop in 3D simulations with detailed neutrino
		  transport despite the presence of convection. This result
		  was obtained with the PROMETHEUS-VERTEX code with the same
		  sophisticated neutrino treatment so far used only in
		  one-dimensional and two-dimensional (2D) models. While
		  buoyant plumes initially determine the nonradial mass
		  motions in the postshock layer, bipolar shock sloshing with
		  growing amplitude sets in during a phase of shock
		  retraction and turns into a violent spiral mode whose
		  growth is only quenched when the infall of the Si/SiO
		  interface leads to strong shock expansion in response to a
		  dramatic decrease of the mass accretion rate. In the phase
		  of large-amplitude SASI sloshing and spiral motions, the
		  postshock layer exhibits nonradial deformation dominated by
		  the lowest-order spherical harmonics (l = 1, m = 0, $\pm$1)
		  in distinct contrast to the higher multipole structures
		  associated with neutrino-driven convection. We find that
		  the SASI amplitudes, shock asymmetry, and nonradial kinetic
		  energy in three dimensions can exceed those of the
		  corresponding 2D case during extended periods of the

  Abstract	= {We investigate the possibility approximating relativistic
		  effects in hydrodynamical simulations of stellar core
		  collapse and post-bounce evolution by using a modified
		  gravitational potential in an otherwise standard Newtonian
		  hydrodynamic code. Different modifications of a previously
		  introduced effective relativistic potential are discussed.
		  Corresponding hydrostatic solutions are compared with
		  solutions of the TOV equations, and hydrodynamic
		  simulations with two different codes are compared with
		  fully relativistic results. One code is applied for one-
		  and two-dimensional calculations with a simple equation of
		  state, and employs either the modified effective
		  relativistic potential in a Newtonian framework or solves
		  the general relativistic field equations under the
		  assumption of the conformal flatness condition (CFC) for
		  the three-metric. The second code allows for full-scale
		  supernova runs including a microphysical equation of state
		  and neutrino transport based on the solution of the
		  Boltzmann equation and its moments equations. We present
		  prescriptions for the effective relativistic potential for
		  self-gravitating fluids to be used in Newtonian codes,
		  which produce excellent agreement with fully relativistic
		  solutions in spherical symmetry, leading to significant
		  improvements compared to previously published
		  approximations. Moreover, they also approximate
		  qualitatively well relativistic solutions for models with

  Abstract	= {During the stalled-shock phase of our three-dimensional,
		  hydrodynamical core-collapse simulations with
		  energy-dependent, three-flavor neutrino transport, the
		  lepton-number flux (nu e minus \bar{nu }_e) emerges
		  predominantly in one hemisphere. This novel,
		  spherical-symmetry breaking neutrino-hydrodynamical
		  instability is termed LESA for "Lepton-number Emission
		  Self-sustained Asymmetry." While the individual nu e and
		  \bar{nu }_e fluxes show a pronounced dipole pattern, the
		  heavy-flavor neutrino fluxes and the overall luminosity are
		  almost spherically symmetric. Initially, LESA seems to
		  develop stochastically from convective fluctuations. It
		  exists for hundreds of milliseconds or more and persists
		  during violent shock sloshing associated with the standing
		  accretion shock instability. The nu e minus \bar{nu }_e
		  flux asymmetry originates predominantly below the
		  neutrinosphere in a region of pronounced proto-neutron star
		  (PNS) convection, which is stronger in the hemisphere of
		  enhanced lepton-number flux. On this side of the PNS, the
		  mass accretion rate of lepton-rich matter is larger,
		  amplifying the lepton-emission asymmetry, because the
		  spherical stellar infall deflects on a dipolar deformation
		  of the stalled shock. The increased shock radius in the
		  hemisphere of less mass accretion and minimal lepton-number
		  flux (\bar{nu }_e flux maximum) is sustained by stronger
		  convection on this side, which is boosted by stronger
		  neutrino heating due to < epsilo \bar{nu _e}> \gt < epsilo
		  nu _e>. Asymmetric heating thus supports the global
		  deformation despite extremely nonstationary convective
		  overturn behind the shock. While these different elements
		  of the LESA phenomenon form a consistent picture, a full
		  understanding remains elusive at present. There may be
		  important implications for neutrino-flavor oscillations,
		  the neutron-to-proton ratio in the neutrino-heated
		  supernova ejecta, and neutron-star kicks, which remain to
		  be explored.},

@Article{	  muller:2012a,
  Abstract	= {Time-dependent and direction-dependent neutrino and
		  gravitational-wave (GW) signatures are presented for a set
		  of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic models of
		  parametrized, neutrino-driven supernova explosions of
		  non-rotating 15 and 20 M&sun; stars. We employed an
		  approximate treatment of neutrino transport based on a gray
		  spectral description and a ray-by-ray treatment of
		  multi-dimensional effects. Owing to the excision of the
		  high-density core of the proto-neutron star (PNS) and the
		  use of an axis-free (Yin-Yang) overset grid, the models can
		  be followed from the post-bounce accretion phase through
		  the onset of the explosion into more than one second of the
		  early cooling evolution of the PNS without imposing any
		  symmetry restrictions and covering a full sphere.
		  Gravitational waves and neutrino emission exhibit the
		  generic time-dependent features already known from 2D
		  (axi-symmetric) models. Violent non-radial hydrodynamic
		  mass motions in the accretion layer and their interaction
		  with the outer layers of the proto-neutron star together
		  with anisotropic neutrino emission give rise to a GW signal
		  with an amplitude of ~5-20 cm in the frequency range of
		  100-500 Hz. The GW emission from mass motions usually
		  reaches a maximum before the explosion sets in. After the
		  onset of the explosion the GW signal exhibits a
		  low-frequency modulation, in some cases describing a
		  quasi-monotonic growth, associated with the non-spherical
		  expansion of the explosion shock wave and the large-scale
		  anisotropy of the escaping neutrino flow. Variations of the
		  mass-quadrupole moment caused by convective activity inside
		  the nascent neutron star add a high-frequency component to
		  the GW signal during the post-explosion phase. The GW
		  signals exhibit strong variability between the two
		  polarizations, different explosion simulations and
		  different observer directions, and besides common basic
		  features do not possess any template character. The
		  neutrino emission properties (fluxes and effective spectral
		  temperatures) show fluctuations over the neutron star
		  surface on spatial and temporal scales that reflect the
		  different types of non-spherical mass motions in the
		  supernova core, i.e., post-shock overturn flows and
		  proto-neutron star convection. However, because very
		  prominent, quasi-periodic sloshing motions of the shock
		  caused by the standing accretion-shock instability are
		  absent and the emission from different surface areas facing
		  an observer adds up incoherently, the modulation amplitudes
		  of the measurable neutrino luminosities and mean energies
		  are significantly lower than predicted by 2D simulations.},

  Abstract	= {We present an overview of four ab initio axisymmetric
		  core-collapse supernova simulations employing detailed
		  spectral neutrino transport computed with our CHIMERA code
		  and initiated from Woosley & Heger progenitors of mass 12,
		  15, 20, and 25 M &sun;. All four models exhibit shock
		  revival over ~200 ms (leading to the possibility of
		  explosion), driven by neutrino energy deposition.
		  Hydrodynamic instabilities that impart substantial
		  asymmetries to the shock aid these revivals, with
		  convection appearing first in the 12 M &sun; model and the
		  standing accretion shock instability appearing first in the
		  25 M &sun; model. Three of the models have developed
		  pronounced prolate morphologies (the 20 M &sun; model has
		  remained approximately spherical). By 500 ms after bounce
		  the mean shock radii in all four models exceed 3000 km and
		  the diagnostic explosion energies are 0.33, 0.66, 0.65, and
		  0.70 Bethe (B = 1051 erg) for the 12, 15, 20, and 25 M
		  &sun; models, respectively, and are increasing. The three
		  least massive of our models are already sufficiently
		  energetic to completely unbind the envelopes of their
		  progenitors (i.e., to explode), as evidenced by our best
		  estimate of their explosion energies, which first become
		  positive at 320, 380, and 440 ms after bounce. By 850 ms
		  the 12 M &sun; diagnostic explosion energy has saturated at

		  the ejecta is ~0.3 B, which is comparable to observations

  Abstract	= {We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulation of
		  the final minutes of iron core growth in a massive star, up
		  to and including the point of core gravitational
		  instability and collapse. We capture the development of
		  strong convection driven by violent Si burning in the shell
		  surrounding the iron core. This convective burning builds
		  the iron core to its critical mass and collapse ensues,
		  driven by electron capture and photodisintegration. The
		  non-spherical structure and motion generated by 3D
		  convection is substantial at the point of collapse, with
		  convective speeds of several hundreds of km s-1. We examine
		  the impact of such physically realistic 3D initial
		  conditions on the core-collapse supernova mechanism using
		  3D simulations including multispecies neutrino leakage and
		  find that the enhanced post-shock turbulence resulting from
		  3D progenitor structure aids successful explosions. We
		  conclude that non-spherical progenitor structure should not
		  be ignored, and should have a significant and favorable
		  impact on the likelihood for neutrino-driven explosions. In
		  order to make simulating the 3D collapse of an iron core
		  feasible, we were forced to make approximations to the
		  nuclear network making this effort only a first step toward
		  accurate, self-consistent 3D stellar evolution models of
		  the end states of massive stars.},

  Abstract	= {We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse
		  supernova simulations initiated from 12, 15, 20, and 25
		  {M}&sun; zero-age main sequence progenitors. All of the
		  simulations yield explosions and have been evolved for at
		  least 1.2 s after core bounce and 1 s after material first
		  becomes unbound. These simulations were computed with our
		  Chimera code employing RbR spectral neutrino transport,
		  special and general relativistic transport effects, and
		  state-of-the-art neutrino interactions. Continuing the
		  evolution beyond 1 s after core bounce allows the
		  explosions to develop more fully and the processes involved
		  in powering the explosions to become more clearly evident.
		  We compute explosion energy estimates, including the
		  negative gravitational binding energy of the stellar
		  envelope outside the expanding shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38,
		  and 0.70 Bethe (B ≡ {10}51 erg) and increasing at 0.03,
		  0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 {\text{B s}}-1, respectively, for the
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 {M}&sun; models at the endpoint of this
		  report. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in
		  our models through detailed analyses of the energy sources
		  and flows. We discuss how the explosion energies may be
		  subject to stochastic variations as exemplfied by the
		  effect of the explosion geometry of the 20 {M}&sun; model
		  in reducing its explosion energy. We compute the
		  proto-neutron star masses and kick velocities. We compare
		  our results for the explosion energies and ejected {}56{Ni}
		  masses against some observational standards despite the
		  large error bars in both models and observations.},

  Abstract	= {We have performed ab initio neutrino radiation
		  hydrodynamics simulations in three and two spatial
		  dimensions (3D and 2D) of core-collapse supernovae from the
		  same 15 M &sun; progenitor through 440 ms after core
		  bounce. Both 3D and 2D models achieve explosions; however,
		  the onset of explosion (shock revival) is delayed by ~100
		  ms in 3D relative to the 2D counterpart and the growth of
		  the diagnostic explosion energy is slower. This is
		  consistent with previously reported 3D simulations
		  utilizing iron-core progenitors with dense mantles. In the
		  ~100 ms before the onset of explosion, diagnostics of
		  neutrino heating and turbulent kinetic energy favor earlier
		  explosion in 2D. During the delay, the angular scale of
		  convective plumes reaching the shock surface grows and
		  explosion in 3D is ultimately lead by a single, large-angle
		  plume, giving the expanding shock a directional orientation
		  not dissimilar from those imposed by axial symmetry in 2D
		  simulations. We posit that shock revival and explosion in

  Abstract	= {We present the first successful simulation of a
		  neutrino-driven supernova explosion in three dimensions
		  (3D), using the Prometheus-Vertex code with an axis-free
		  Yin-Yang grid and a sophisticated treatment of
		  three-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport. The
		  progenitor is a nonrotating, zero-metallicity 9.6 {{M}&sun;
		  } star with an iron core. While in spherical symmetry
		  outward shock acceleration sets in later than 300 ms after
		  bounce, a successful explosion starts at ˜130 ms
		  postbounce in two dimensions (2D). The 3D model explodes at
		  about the same time but with faster shock expansion than in
		  2D and a more quickly increasing and roughly 10% higher
		  explosion energy of >1050 erg. The more favorable explosion
		  conditions in 3D are explained by lower temperatures and
		  thus reduced neutrino emission in the cooling layer below
		  the gain radius. This moves the gain radius inward and
		  leads to a bigger mass in the gain layer, whose larger
		  recombination energy boosts the explosion energy in 3D.
		  These differences are caused by less coherent, less
		  massive, and less rapid convective downdrafts associated
		  with postshock convection in 3D. The less violent impact of
		  these accretion downflows in the cooling layer produces
		  less shock heating and therefore diminishes energy losses
		  by neutrino emission. We thus have, for the first time,
		  identified a reduced mass accretion rate, lower infall
		  velocities, and a smaller surface filling factor of
		  convective downdrafts as consequences of 3D postshock
		  turbulence that facilitate neutrino-driven explosions and
		  strengthen them compared to the 2D case.},

		  symmetric, general-relativistic hydrodynamics,
		  core-collapse supernova (CCSN) code GR1D. The source code
		  is available at http://www.GR1Dcode.org. We extend its
		  capabilities to include a general-relativistic treatment of
		  neutrino transport based on the moment formalisms of
		  Shibata et al. and Cardall et al. We pay special attention
		  to implementing and testing numerical methods and
		  approximations that lessen the computational demand of the
		  transport scheme by removing the need to invert large
		  matrices. This is especially important for the
		  implementation and development of moment-like transport
		  methods in two and three dimensions. A critical component
		  of neutrino transport calculations is the neutrino-matter
		  interaction coefficients that describe the production,
		  absorption, scattering, and annihilation of neutrinos. In
		  this article we also describe our open-source neutrino
		  interaction library NuLib (available at
		  http://www.nulib.org). We believe that an open-source
		  approach to describing these interactions is one of the
		  major steps needed to progress toward robust models of
		  CCSNe and robust predictions of the neutrino signal. We
		  show, via comparisons to full Boltzmann neutrino-transport
		  simulations of CCSNe, that our neutrino transport code
		  performs remarkably well. Furthermore, we show that the
		  methods and approximations we employ to increase efficiency
		  do not decrease the fidelity of our results. We also test
		  the ability of our general-relativistic transport code to
		  model failed CCSNe by evolving a 40-solar-mass progenitor
		  to the onset of collapse to a black hole.},

  Abstract	= {We substantially update the capabilities of the
		  open-source software instrument Modules for Experiments in
		  Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). MESA can now simultaneously
		  evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars
		  undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum,
		  greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary
		  evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled
		  calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes
		  now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning
		  stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models.
		  Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with
		  MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star
		  lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of
		  core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting
		  explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation
		  instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the
		  instability strips for massive stars while also
		  accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology
		  data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving
		  more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA
		  capability to calculate weak reaction rates ``on-the-fly''
		  from input nuclear data allows better simulation of
		  accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the
		  fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing
		  challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled
		  plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now
		  allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy
		  elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA
		  software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency
		  for all results across all the supported platforms, a
		  profound enabling capability for accelerating MESA's
		  development.},

@Article{	  lee:2013,
  Abstract	= {In this paper, we extend the unsplit staggered mesh scheme
		  (USM) for 2D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) [D. Lee, A.E.
		  Deane, An unsplit staggered mesh scheme for
		  multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics, J. Comput. Phys. 228
		  (2009) 952-975] to a full 3D MHD scheme. The scheme is a
		  finite-volume Godunov method consisting of a constrained
		  transport (CT) method and an efficient and accurate
		  single-step, directionally unsplit multidimensional data
		  reconstruction-evolution algorithm, which extends Colella's
		  original 2D corner transport upwind (CTU) method [P.
		  Colella, Multidimensional upwind methods for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws, J. Comput. Phys. 87 (1990) 446-466]. We
		  present two types of data reconstruction-evolution
		  algorithms for 3D: (1) a reduced CTU scheme and (2) a full
		  CTU scheme. The reduced 3D CTU scheme is a variant of a
		  simple 3D extension of Collela's 2D CTU method and is
		  considered as a direct extension from the 2D USM scheme.
		  The full 3D CTU scheme is our primary 3D solver which
		  includes all multidimensional cross-derivative terms for
		  stability. The latter method is logically analogous to the
		  3D unsplit CTU method by Saltzman [J. Saltzman, An unsplit
		  3D upwind method for hyperbolic conservation laws, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 115 (1994) 153-168]. The major novelties in
		  our algorithms are twofold. First, we extend the reduced
		  CTU scheme to the full CTU scheme which is able to run with
		  CFL numbers close to unity. Both methods utilize the
		  transverse update technique developed in the 2D USM
		  algorithm to account for transverse fluxes without solving
		  intermediate Riemann problems, which in turn gives
		  cost-effective 3D methods by reducing the total number of
		  Riemann solves. The proposed algorithms are simple and
		  efficient especially when including multidimensional MHD
		  terms that maintain in-plane magnetic field dynamics.
		  Second, we introduce a new CT scheme that makes use of
		  proper upwind information in taking averages of electric
		  fields. Our 3D USM schemes can be easily combined with
		  various reconstruction methods (e.g., first-order Godunov,
		  second-order MUSCL-Hancock, third-order PPM and fifth-order
		  WENO), and a wide choice of 1D based Riemann solvers (e.g.,
		  local Lax-Friedrichs, HLLE, HLLC, HLLD, and Roe). The 3D
		  USM-MHD solver is available in the University of Chicago
		  Flash Center's official FLASH release.},

  Abstract	= {We present the first 4pi-three-dimensional (3D) simulation
		  of the last minutes of oxygen shell burning in an 18 M
		  &sun; supernova progenitor up to the onset of core
		  collapse. A moving inner boundary is used to accurately
		  model the contraction of the silicon and iron core
		  according to a one-dimensional stellar evolution model with
		  a self-consistent treatment of core deleptonization and
		  nuclear quasi-equilibrium. The simulation covers the full
		  solid angle to allow the emergence of large-scale
		  convective modes. Due to core contraction and the
		  concomitant acceleration of nuclear burning, the convective
		  Mach number increases to ˜0.1 at collapse, and an l = 2
		  mode emerges shortly before the end of the simulation.
		  Aside from a growth of the oxygen shell from 0.51 M &sun;
		  to 0.56 M &sun; due to entrainment from the carbon shell,
		  the convective flow is reasonably well described by
		  mixing-length theory, and the dominant scales are
		  compatible with estimates from linear stability analysis.
		  We deduce that artificial changes in the physics, such as
		  accelerated core contraction, can have precarious
		  consequences for the state of convection at collapse. We
		  argue that scaling laws for the convective velocities and
		  eddy sizes furnish good estimates for the state of shell
		  convection at collapse and develop a simple analytic theory
		  for the impact of convective seed perturbations on shock
		  revival in the ensuing supernova. We predict a reduction of
		  the critical luminosity for explosion by 12%-24% due to
		  seed asphericities for our 3D progenitor model relative to
		  the case without large seed perturbations.},

  Abstract	= {In this article we develop an improved version of the
		  classical fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory
		  finite difference scheme of [G.S. Jiang, C.W. Shu,
		  Efficient implementation of weighted ENO schemes, J.
		  Comput. Phys. 126 (1996) 202-228] (WENO-JS) for hyperbolic
		  conservation laws. Through the novel use of a linear
		  combination of the low order smoothness indicators already
		  present in the framework of WENO-JS, a new smoothness
		  indicator of higher order is devised and new
		  non-oscillatory weights are built, providing a new WENO
		  scheme (WENO-Z) with less dissipation and higher resolution
		  than the classical WENO. This new scheme generates
		  solutions that are sharp as the ones of the mapped WENO
		  scheme (WENO-M) of Henrick et al. [A.K. Henrick, T.D.
		  Aslam, J.M. Powers, Mapped weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory schemes: achieving optimal order near
		  critical points, J. Comput. Phys. 207 (2005) 542-567],
		  however with a 25% reduction in CPU costs, since no mapping
		  is necessary. We also provide a detailed analysis of the
		  convergence of the WENO-Z scheme at critical points of
		  smooth solutions and show that the solution enhancements of
		  WENO-Z and WENO-M at problems with shocks comes from their
		  ability to assign substantially larger weights to
		  discontinuous stencils than the WENO-JS scheme, not from
		  their superior order of convergence at critical points.
		  Numerical solutions of the linear advection of
		  discontinuous functions and nonlinear hyperbolic
		  conservation laws as the one dimensional Euler equations
		  with Riemann initial value problems, the Mach 3
		  shock-density wave interaction and the blastwave problems
		  are compared with the ones generated by the WENO-JS and
		  WENO-M schemes. The good performance of the WENO-Z scheme
		  is also demonstrated in the simulation of two dimensional
		  problems as the shock-vortex interaction and a Mach 4.46
		  Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability (RMI) modeled via the two
		  dimensional Euler equations.},

  Abstract	= {We describe a single step, second-order accurate Godunov
		  scheme for ideal MHD based on combining the piecewise
		  parabolic method (PPM) for performing spatial
		  reconstruction, the corner transport upwind (CTU) method of
		  Colella for multidimensional integration, and the
		  constrained transport (CT) algorithm for preserving the
		  divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field. We adopt
		  the most compact form of CT, which requires the field be
		  represented by area-averages at cell faces. We demonstrate
		  that the fluxes of the area-averaged field used by CT can
		  be made consistent with the fluxes of the volume-averaged
		  field returned by a Riemann solver if they obey certain
		  simple relationships. We use these relationships to derive
		  new algorithms for constructing the CT fluxes at grid cell
		  corners which reduce exactly to the equivalent
		  one-dimensional solver for plane-parallel, grid-aligned
		  flow. We show that the PPM reconstruction algorithm must
		  include multidimensional terms for MHD, and we describe a
		  number of important extensions that must be made to CTU in
		  order for it to be used for MHD with CT. We present the
		  results of a variety of test problems to demonstrate the

  Abstract	= {We present and compare third- as well as fifth-order
		  accurate finite difference schemes for the numerical
		  solution of the compressible ideal MHD equations in
		  multiple spatial dimensions. The selected methods lean on
		  four different reconstruction techniques based on recently
		  improved versions of the weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes, monotonicity preserving
		  (MP) schemes as well as slope-limited polynomial
		  reconstruction. The proposed numerical methods are highly
		  accurate in smooth regions of the flow, avoid loss of
		  accuracy in proximity of smooth extrema and provide sharp
		  non-oscillatory transitions at discontinuities. We suggest
		  a numerical formulation based on a cell-centered approach
		  where all of the primary flow variables are discretized at
		  the zone center. The divergence-free condition is enforced
		  by augmenting the MHD equations with a generalized Lagrange
		  multiplier yielding a mixed hyperbolic/parabolic
		  correction, as in Dedner et al. [J. Comput. Phys. 175
		  (2002) 645-673]. The resulting family of schemes is robust,
		  cost-effective and straightforward to implement. Compared
		  to previous existing approaches, it completely avoids the
		  CPU intensive workload associated with an elliptic
		  divergence cleaning step and the additional complexities
		  required by staggered mesh algorithms. Extensive numerical
		  testing demonstrate the robustness and reliability of the
		  proposed framework for computations involving both smooth
		  and discontinuous features.},

  Abstract	= {We present a high-order accurate weighted essentially
		  non-oscillatory (WENO) finite difference scheme for solving
		  the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). This
		  scheme is a direct extension of a WENO scheme, which has
		  been successfully applied to hydrodynamic problems. The
		  WENO scheme follows the same idea of an essentially
		  non-oscillatory (ENO) scheme with an advantage of achieving
		  higher-order accuracy with fewer computations. Both ENO and
		  WENO can be easily applied to two and three spatial
		  dimensions by evaluating the fluxes dimension-by-dimension.
		  Details of the WENO scheme as well as the construction of a
		  suitable eigen-system, which can properly decompose various
		  families of MHD waves and handle the degenerate situations,
		  are presented. Numerical results are shown to perform well
		  for the one-dimensional Brio-Wu Riemann problems, the
		  two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problems, and
		  the two-dimensional Orszag-Tang MHD vortex system. They
		  also demonstrate the importance of maintaining the
		  divergence free condition for the magnetic field in
		  achieving numerical stability. The tests also show the
		  advantages of using the higher-order scheme. The new

  Abstract	= {A new multi-state Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL) approximate
		  Riemann solver for the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
		  equations is developed based on the assumption that the
		  normal velocity is constant over the Riemann fan. This
		  assumption is same as that used in the HLLC ("C" denotes
		  Contact) approximate Riemann solver for the Euler
		  equations. From the assumption, it is naturally derived
		  that the Riemann fan should consist of four intermediate
		  states for Bx != 0, whereas the number of the intermediate
		  states is reduced to two when Bx = 0. Since the
		  intermediate states satisfied with all jump conditions in
		  this approximate Riemann system are analytically obtained,
		  the multi-state HLL Riemann solver can be constructed
		  straightforwardly. It is shown that this solver can exactly
		  resolve isolated discontinuities formed in the MHD system,
		  and hence named as HLLD Riemann solver. (Here, "D" stands
		  for Discontinuities.) It is also analytically proved that
		  the HLLD Riemann solver is positively conservative like the
		  HLLC Riemann solver. Indeed, the HLLD Riemann solver
		  corresponds to the HLLC Riemann solver when the magnetic
		  field vanishes. Numerical tests demonstrate that the HLLD
		  Riemann solver is more robust and efficient than the
		  linearized Riemann solver, and its resolution is equally
		  good. It indicates that the HLLD solver must be useful in
		  practical applications for the ideal MHD equations.},

  Abstract	= {Carefully accounting for neutrino transport is an
		  essential component of many astrophysical studies. Solving
		  the full transport equation is too expensive for most
		  realistic applications, especially those involving multiple
		  spatial dimensions. For such cases, resorting to
		  approximations is often the only viable option for
		  obtaining solutions. One such approximation, which recently
		  became popular, is the M1 method. It utilizes the system of
		  the lowest two moments of the transport equation and closes
		  the system with an ad hoc closure relation. The accuracy of
		  the M1 solution depends on the quality of the closure.
		  Several closures have been proposed in the literature and
		  have been used in various studies. We carry out an
		  extensive study of these closures by comparing the results
		  of M1 calculations with precise Monte Carlo calculations of
		  the radiation field around spherically-symmetric
		  protoneutron star models. We find that no closure performs
		  consistently better or worse than others in all cases. The
		  level of accuracy a given closure yields depends on the
		  matter configuration, neutrino type, and neutrino energy.
		  Given this limitation, the maximum entropy closure by
		  Minerbo (1978) on average yields relatively accurate
		  results in the broadest set of cases considered in this
		  work.},

  Abstract	= {We perform the first self-consistent, time-dependent,
		  multi-group calculations in two dimensions (2D) to address
		  the consequences of using the ray-by-ray+ transport
		  simplification in core-collapse supernova simulations. Such
		  a dimensional reduction is employed by many researchers to
		  facilitate their resource-intensive calculations. Our new
		  code (Fornax) implements multi-D transport, and can, by
		  zeroing out transverse flux terms, emulate the ray-by-ray+
		  scheme. Using the same microphysics, initial models,
		  resolution, and code, we compare the results of simulating
		  12, 15, 20, and 25 M &sun; progenitor models using these
		  two transport methods. Our findings call into question the
		  wisdom of the pervasive use of the ray-by-ray+ approach.
		  Employing it leads to maximum post-bounce/pre-explosion
		  shock radii that are almost universally larger by tens of
		  kilometers than those derived using the more accurate
		  scheme, typically leaving the post-bounce matter less bound
		  and artificially more ``explodable.'' In fact, for our 25 M
		  &sun; progenitor, the ray-by-ray+ model explodes, while the
		  corresponding multi-D transport model does not. Therefore,
		  in two dimensions, the combination of ray-by-ray+ with the
		  axial sloshing hydrodynamics that is a feature of 2D
		  supernova dynamics can result in quantitatively, and
		  perhaps qualitatively, incorrect results.},

  Abstract	= {We present the new code ALCAR developed to model
		  multidimensional, multienergy-group neutrino transport in
		  the context of supernovae and neutron-star mergers. The
		  algorithm solves the evolution equations of the zeroth- and
		  first-order angular moments of the specific intensity,
		  supplemented by an algebraic relation for the second-moment
		  tensor to close the system. The scheme takes into account
		  frame-dependent effects of the order O(v/c) as well as the
		  most important types of neutrino interactions. The
		  transport scheme is significantly more efficient than a
		  multidimensional solver of the Boltzmann equation, while it
		  is more accurate and consistent than the flux-limited
		  diffusion method. The finite-volume discretization of the
		  essentially hyperbolic system of moment equations employs
		  methods well-known from hydrodynamics. For the time
		  integration of the potentially stiff moment equations we
		  employ a scheme in which only the local source terms are
		  treated implicitly, while the advection terms are kept
		  explicit, thereby allowing for an efficient computational
		  parallelization of the algorithm. We investigate various
		  problem set-ups in one and two dimensions to verify the
		  implementation and to test the quality of the algebraic
		  closure scheme. In our most detailed test, we compare a
		  fully dynamic, one-dimensional core-collapse simulation
		  with two published calculations performed with well-known

  Abstract	= {We present a new multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics
		  code for massive stellar core-collapse in full general
		  relativity (GR). Employing an M1 analytical closure scheme,
		  we solve spectral neutrino transport of the radiation
		  energy and momentum based on a truncated moment formalism.
		  Regarding neutrino opacities, we take into account a
		  baseline set in state-of-the-art simulations, in which
		  inelastic neutrino-electron scattering, thermal neutrino
		  production via pair annihilation, and nucleon-nucleon
		  bremsstrahlung are included. While the Einstein field
		  equations and the spatial advection terms in the
		  radiation-hydrodynamics equations are evolved explicitly,
		  the source terms due to neutrino-matter interactions and
		  energy shift in the radiation moment equations are
		  integrated implicitly by an iteration method. To verify our
		  code, we first perform a series of standard radiation tests
		  with analytical solutions that include the check of
		  gravitational redshift and Doppler shift. A good agreement
		  in these tests supports the reliability of the GR
		  multi-energy neutrino transport scheme. We then conduct
		  several test simulations of core-collapse, bounce, and
		  shock stall of a 15{M}&sun; star in the Cartesian
		  coordinates and make a detailed comparison with published
		  results. Our code performs quite well to reproduce the
		  results of full Boltzmann neutrino transport especially
		  before bounce. In the postbounce phase, our code basically
		  performs well, however, there are several differences that
		  are most likely to come from the insufficient spatial
		  resolution in our current 3D-GR models. For clarifying the
		  resolution dependence and extending the code comparison in
		  the late postbounce phase, we discuss that next-generation
		  Exaflops class supercomputers are needed at least.},
